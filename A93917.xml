            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>After he hath commended him for his <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weariable induſtry</hi> and <hi>ſingular proficiency</hi> in his owne, and his <hi>abilitie</hi> and <hi>willingneſſe</hi> to bee helpefull to others <hi>Studies,</hi> even while hee was young in the <hi>Colledge;</hi> Hee deſcends to the conſideration of him in his publique cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, That he proved <hi>a painefull, a faithfull Miniſter of Chriſt, a skilfull, a powerfull diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of Gods word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The proofes of which were, his conſtant and inceſſant imployments in <hi>Preaching</hi> twice every Sabbath for many yeeres; beſides his <hi>Catechiſing</hi> the younger ſort in the week days, (which he did with notable diſcretion, the males and females apart, the riper and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder
<pb facs="tcp:151759:12"/>in the preſence of the ruder and rawer, and then the rawer by themſelves; together with other offices of his Paſtorall function, privatly performed.</p>
                  <p>Which <hi>Miniſtery</hi> of his was very effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, ſo that beſides many other Chriſtian Souls converted by him (in which ſucceſſe few Miniſters were to bee compared with him) many faithfull Miniſters alſo received their firſt beginnings of light and ſpirituall life and grace, from his Miniſtery; So that he did not only winne many ſoules, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny winners of Souls.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe two things which make a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat man, had an happy conjunction in him, namely <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Judgement.</hi> The proofes of which were, both the deſire that many had to uſe him for the overſight of their laſt Wils, and for the diſpoſing of their eſtates; And that ſo many reverend Miniſters from all parts of the <hi>Realme</hi> did by Letters or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe uſually ſeeke to him for the reſolution of their doubts.</p>
                  <p>As theſe made him a <hi>Compleat man,</hi> ſo he had that which made him a <hi>Compleat Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> namely, <hi>That he could ſpeake his mind fitly,</hi> and <hi>That he durſt ſpeake it freely.</hi> For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, his ability to expreſſe himſelfe, <hi>with cleare Method, ſound proofes, choiſe words, fit
<pb facs="tcp:151759:12"/>phraſe, pregnant ſimilitudes, plentifull illuſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, pithy perſwaſions, ſweet inſinuations, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full inforcements, allegations of antiquitie, and varietie of good literature;</hi> he was ſuch an one as many ſtrove to imitate, not many of them matched. For the other, his <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of ſpeech</hi> in reproving of ſinne even to the faces of the greateſt, many are able to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, and ſome accidents made it more publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne, then his deſire was it ſhould have been.</p>
                  <p>Among other particular commendations of him, One was his zealous and earneſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of reformation of ſome prophanations of the Sabbath, wherein he prevailed alſo for the alteration of ſome things in that kind offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, as well with the maine body of the City, as with ſome particular <hi>Societies.</hi> Another was his pious care &amp; diligence in the religious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and education of thoſe that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his private charge, children and others.</p>
                  <p>In theſe and the like imployments, hee ſpent his time, he ſpent his ſtrength, till God put an end to his inceſſant labours here, and tranſlated him to the place of his endleſſe reſt.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Iſraelites</hi> provoked to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and heavy diſpleaſure by their ſinnes the Monarch of the whole world: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he being thus diſpleaſed, ſent againſt them <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> who tooke them, and carried the King, his Princes and the whole people into <hi>Babel,</hi> after that he had ſpoyled their ſtately Temple, deſtroy'd their ſtrong Walls, and laid waſte <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſelfe; where they endured <hi>70.</hi> yeares exile and baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which yeares expired, they were againe brought to their Countrey, when and where better things were expected from them, both in way of thankefulneſſe, and in remembrance of their former Captivity, leſt a worſe thing ſhould afterwards befall them. But they forgetfull of former things, both beatings &amp; benefits, as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are, returned to their ſinnes, polluted the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip, gave themſelves to divers vices, began to make marriages with Infidels, againe embraced Polygamy, took up the cuſtome of giving bills of divorce, committed ſacriledges, caſt out ſtrange contempts againſt God, and blaſphemies: By all which the Lord being againe provoked,
<pb facs="tcp:151759:14"/>ſent the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> to reprove them ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to threaten them ſeverely with certaine new judgments, and to the impenitent certaine &amp; finall deſtruction; yet in the meane time cheering up the good with comforts, provoking them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, perſwading them to faith in Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing them with many ſweet promiſes.</p>
                  <p>Now it is no hard thing to make the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and apply theſe things to our times, that it may appeare, the handling of this is no unfit thing, but apt to the time.</p>
                  <p>For the ſinnes of the Land God was diſpleaſed, and gave over the people to captivity (though in their owne Land ſomewhat leſſe than this, yet it was) both of body and ſoule to a new <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar,</hi> which makes it the greater, the Church and ſpirituall <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> much defaced, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of it partly put to flight, partly to the fire. But ſee how good God was, after a time he brought againe our Captivity. After which he looked for better things from us, and haply had them while the benefit was freſh, and the bondage yet felt. But ſee, theſe are worne out of minde, and we againe have committed great ſins againſt God, by which we juſtly have provoked Gods indignation againſt us, yea and alas, we ceaſe not to provoke it; for how great contempt of the ſervice of God is there in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very place? what prophaneneſſe? what corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of manners? what unfaithfulneſſe in covenant breaking? what uncleaneneſſe in marriage? what
<pb facs="tcp:151759:14"/>horrible oaths? what fearefull perjuries? what execrable blaſphemies againſt the Higheſt? not in meane perſons, but of the higheſt rankes; not in Countries only, but in famous Cities; not in meane mens Cottages onely, but in noble mens places and Palaces, in Church and Common-wealth: ſo that the Lord may ſay to us, as he ſaid to <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachy,</hi> Chap. <hi>16.</hi> becauſe neither honour nor feare be performed to him. So that not onely juſt are thoſe plagues that are come upon us, peſtilence to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy now almoſt three yeares, and famine to the ſoule begun, and threatned more, but alſo particular &amp; generall judgments. Whatſoever is in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, may juſtly both be threatned and executed upon us; when it is juſt with God, where like ſins are, to bring upon them like puniſhments.</p>
                  <p>This is the reaſon of my choyſe, as alſo the ſumme and argument of this Propheſie.</p>

The burden not of the Word onely, but of the rod of the Lord, not threatned, but executed, hath beene upon our Land and Church by the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Plague; now well towards three yeares wee have walked in the land of the dead, we have beene in the houſe of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:151759:17"/>Indeed the living hath laid it to his heart, but ſo few have done it, that the dead are more than the living; not onely our wanton women, and voluptuous men, to whom that 1 Tim. 5.6. <hi>They are dead while they live:</hi> but our worldly men, our ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and others all dead, for this they have not felt. We ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for fifty &amp; odde thouſands that dyed in the former yeare; we have as much need to ſorrow for ſo many thouſands yet living, and dead amongſt us; they never indeed felt, nor yet doe feele this burden: Their irreligious carriage when it was here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, both at home &amp; abroad, in the City and abroad, their ſmall conformity ſince to the Law of God, little reforming of their corruptions, nay, their monſtrous deformity in themſelves, wives, and children, perſwades my heart, as 'tis Pſal. 36.1. <hi>The tranſgreſſion of the wicked ſaith within my heart, there is no feare of God before my eyes:</hi> ſo that they had no feeling of this at all; for they who truely felt it, would grow ſomewhat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if not altogether reformed. If an heatheniſh people, who knew not God, at the burden of the Word of the Lord did ſo humble themſelves, that the Lord ſaid, <hi>Jonah</hi> 8.10. <hi>He repented of the evill he ſaid he would doe to you, and did it not;</hi> what ſhall be thought of Chriſtian men by profeſſion, living in the Church of God, if at the burden of his Word they repent not, nor depart from their evill wayes? but Iſaiah 8.8. <hi>Though they be ſtricken, revolt more and more:</hi> it is becauſe they are dead men, and cannot feele it. Oh then weepe not for me, but for your ſelves, and children, as thoſe not for the departed, but for the living dead: for if it be true, The beginning of the remedy is the ſence and acknowledgment of the malady; how farre are they from cure that have not yet the feeling of it? I feared the Plague by a naturall infirmity, though God enabled me to abide upon my calling in the hotteſt brunt of it, and mercifully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved me hitherto to his Church, and to ſpeake this to you this day. But if it ſhould now come by the providence of God upon me, that he beginnes to threaten it to the City, I ſhould willingly embrace it, as thinking God to be marvellous merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto me, and whoſoever he ſhould ſmite by it, to take it thus into his owne hand, and not to leave us to more fearefull judgments, which I cannot ſay, but I marvellouſly feare, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at the doore to the wakening of dead men and women, or the ſweeping of them away.

                        <p>This ought to teach men in affliction, if a judgment come, and impoſed by the hand of God, to beare it patiently and meekely, as <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 15.25, 26. for it is a burden. The way to be eaſed, is not ſtrugling with it, but meekely to beare it; for a priſoner to be free from his fetters, is not in the Jaylors
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151759:17"/>ſight to ſeeke to breake them, or to file them off; that is the way to procure more, or the longer lying in them: So, to be eaſed of a burden, is not to wreſtle with it when one is under it, but to goe ſoftly; there is more eaſe while it is on his back, and ſooner comes he to be releaſed of it. A man may with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiency wreſtle and uſe unlawfull meanes to eaſe himſelfe, and God happly will let them proſper for a while; but after he will bring a more heavy and inevitable burden on him, that with his former ſhifts ſhall make more heavy to him. There is a fable, but it hath his Morall for this purpoſe; A certaine Aſſe laded with Salt, fell into a river, and after he had riſen, found his burthen lighter, for the moiſture made it melt away; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he would ever after lye him downe in the water as he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with his burthen, and ſo eaſe himſelfe: His owner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his craft, after laded him as heavy with Wooll; the Aſſe purpoſing to eaſe himſelfe, as before, laid himſelfe downe in the next water, and thinking to have eaſe, riſing againe to feele his weight, found it heavier, as it continued with him all the day. The Morall is, that they who impatiently ſeeke meanes contrary to the will of God, to eaſe themſelves of their burden, ſhall have it more and more encreaſe upon them.</p>
                        <p>That men ſhould make a ſpeciall reſtraint to themſelves to keepe from ſinning, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> becauſe an heavy and grievous burden elſe is ready to be laid upon their ſhoulders. Sinne it ſelfe is an heavy burden, but few feele it, and fewer feare it; but to this burden ſhall the burden of puniſhment be added; and who is ſufficient for theſe things? if the firſt burden feare them not, becauſe there is ſome pleaſure in ſinne to the fleſh, yet let the ſecond, which hath no pleaſure at all. When thou art tempted to ſinne, by which thou muſt needs tempt and provoke God, learne to caſt thy accompts well, conſult if thou bee able to meete him that comes againſt thee, Luke 14. ſo, if thou bee'ſt able to meete him, and beare his burden, goe on, and ſpare not; delight in all thy wayes, reſtraine thy ſelfe from no ſinne: but if not, if we may invert and reſolve, <hi>Doe we provoke the Lord to jealouſie? are we ſtronger than he?</hi> 1 Cor. 20.22. then let this reſtraine us, if nothing elſe will; let us imitate Porters, who called, and offered money to beare a burden, will poiſe and weigh the burden in their hands firſt, which when they ſee they are not able to beare, no gaine will entice them; ſo in this caſe let us doe.</p>

Sometime when Prophets were more frequent and perpetuall in the Church, and God ſpoke to them by dreames, or by viſions, and apparitions, they had divers kinds of words, and had liberty for divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of ſpeaking and delivery: But our Prophet was ſuch a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, that the Commandement hee had received, and was credited with, he muſt deliver in ſo many words, and the ſame he received them in, and ſo he doth; for in the whole he never uſeth his owne perſon, but the Lord onely, as Chap. 1.2. and 2.1. and 3.1. and 4.1.</p>

                        <p>Love given to God, ſignifies not a paſſion nor affection, for there is no ſuch thing in God. <hi>Ira Dei non perturbatio animi e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus, ſed judicium quo irrogatur poena peccato.

So of this, it is no paſſion, but his free election to beſtow, yea, an actuall gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to them the adoption of ſonnes and eternall life. For God is ſaid to be angry, when he doth that which commonly men doe when they are angry; and to love, when he doth that which men doe when they love. Now this cannot be underſtood of his generall love, of which all are partakers, men and Angels, bleſſing, preſerving, ſuſtaining them: for then were it no great matter that he affirmes here to his. But of a ſpeciall love, that is, his chooſing of them to be ſonnes, and to beſtow on them eternall life. I have loved you, that is, I have choſen you to be my people, and I will be your God; to be my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and I will be your Father, and to give you the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſonnes, than which what can be greater? <hi>Hierome</hi>

                        <p>The firſt ſinne reproved is unthankfulneſſe, the reproofe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing covertly inſinuated, rather than openly ſet downe, under the recording and recalling of Gods love and the fruits of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they had beene partakers. <hi>Hierome</hi> obſerveth here, leſt the puniſhment ſhould ſeeme unjuſt, and God ſhould without cauſe afflict them, and lay the burden upon them, he addeth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of their ſinnes.

Ingratitude and unthankfulneſſe unto God for his love, and the fruits of it, the bleſſings men receive, either ſpirituall or temporall, is a very great ſinne. So the Lord ſhews it here by his Prophet, when he puts it in the foremoſt of all other ſinnes in this people, and as the principall which makes him threaten this burden unto them. So <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1.2. ſets it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other ſinnes. It is by the Apoſtle put among the ſinnes of the laſt dayes, when iniquity ſhall get the upper hand, and muſt abound, 2 Tim. 3.2. This ſinne is committed five waies, or there are five kinds or degrees of unthankfull men. Firſt, when men doe not acknowledge God as the Authour and giver of their benefits and bleſſings, but finde out others, as Hoſea 2.8, 9. <hi>Shee knew not that the Lord gave her Corne.</hi> Secondly, when men doe forget him and his benefits, againſt which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> laboured.

Such were the nine Lepers. Fourthly, when not onely theſe, but recompenſe him evill for good, as that, Iſaiah 1.2. <hi>I have brought up children, and they have rebelled againſt me.</hi> Deut. 32.5, 6. Fiftly, not faulty in any of theſe, but doe not walke worthy of ſuch mercies, when he doth not render according to the benefit done unto him, as it was ſaid of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 Chro. 32.25.</p>

But ſay they be ſo farre inſtructed that they confeſſe him the giver, yet how ſome have forgotten him and his benefits. A ſecond brings the oblivion of the firſt, a third of that, &amp;c. As one naile drives out another, but an affliction makes all to be forgotten: as with men, one injury they doe us, makes us forget they ever did us good. But ſay benefits be remembred, and oftentimes ſpoken of, yet not ſo much as the afflictions and troubles: or if at one time many words to expreſſe the paſſion in ſuffering, few in receiving; or if of them, yet as Courtiers bragge of the Kings favour, as <hi>Haman,</hi> Eſter 5.11, 12. more to magnifie himſelfe than the Kings liberality: for a long ſtory they will tell you of their wealth, and honour, and children, and ſuch like; but a few words, and that very unſavourily will they drop out of praiſe to God. They make not their Song or Pſalmes of thankeſgiving as the faithfull have done. But if any can plead not guilty here, and be culpable in none of theſe, yet his unthankfulneſſe appeares that he ſtill remaines in his ſinne, and rebells againſt the Lord; not onely offending him, but by thoſe things he hath received from him: more than any married and modeſt woman will doe to her huſband, by the Rings, Chaines, Bracelets, Apparrell, and ornaments he gave her to adorne her, ſo ſhe might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him; not that ſhee ſhould give to an adulterer, to entice him to folly. And yet what elſe doe many, but by their riches and honours, their health and beautie, by their ſtrength and valour, and ſuch like, diſhonour him? By their riches they waxe proud againſt God, by their honours and high places they oppreſſe others without feare: health makes them ſtudy the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orning and trimming of the body, by their beautie they entice others, by their valour they contemne others, and like mighty <hi>Nimrods</hi> they tyrannize in peace and warre: ſo that God for all his coſt hath not Grapes, but ſower Grapes, as Iſaiah 5. But

Now becauſe there neither is, nor can be true repentance where there is perſeverance in it, nor unleſſe it be forſaken, and the former good acted; for he is ungratefull, that is not thankfull; as he is wicked, that is not juſt; the contrary evill is ever where the good is not, where and when it ought to be. Therefore muſt every one labour for the good, and ſtrive to be thankefull, to acknowledge, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, to praiſe, to abſtaine from evill, to reward with all good offices for ſuch great kindneſſe: Hee muſt ſtirre up the beſt inſtrument that he hath to praiſe the Lord, whoſe nature (as one ſaith) is ſuch,<note place="margin">In conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis beneficiis eſt liberaliſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, ita in gratiarum actionibus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſcendis eſt avariſſima.</note> that in conferring of benefits hee is moſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall, and moſt covetous in requiring acknowledgment. This is moſt acceptable to him, like the ſcent of all ſacrifices, Levit. 3.16, 17. Let it repent us that we have deprived him of ſo much as is due to him, and now ſtrive to it, ſinging the ſongs of thankeſgiving with cheerefull hearts when hee calls us to it, not loving him otherwiſe than hee hath done us, both in word and deed: ceaſing to grieve him, ſeeking to pleaſe him, and to recompence as he hath rewarded us. <hi>Et ſi gravia praeterierunt, tamen gravium memoria ne praetereat; non ut doleamus, ſed ut gratias agamus.</hi> Chryſoſt. <hi>Hom.</hi> 12. <hi>ad popul.

Can a woman forget her child, and not have compaſſion on the ſonne of her wombe? though they ſhould forget, yet will I not forget thee: therefore they may beſt have their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation without care or covetouſneſſe; they need not ſweare or deceive for gaine, oppreſſe, or offer injury to provide for themſelves; they need not prophane the Lords day, nor uſe unlawfull meanes to lay up for another time to come: for hee that doth ſo ſpecially love them, and hath laid up ſo great things for them, and given them the pledges of them already, and the earneſt of ſuch infinite things, how will not he take care of them to provide neceſſaries for them. He that in his generall love feeds the Ravens, the Lions, and Leopards; makes his raine to fall, and his Sunne to ſhine upon the wicked, and fills their bellies with his hid treaſures; what will his ſpeciall love make him to his owne? but many of his are often-times ſcanted. So the Phyſitian keeps his patient at a ſtrait diet, when full diſhes are hurtfull unto him.

But they often want much, and have ſcarce to ſatisfie nature, when the wicked have abundance; but their water and browne bread makes them looke as well as all the full diſhes of the wicked; as it was with <hi>Daniel</hi> and his fellows.

                           <hi>ANd I hated</hi> Eſau, <hi>and made his mountaines waſte.</hi>] Some think that this is only added to prove his hatred to <hi>Eſau; viz.</hi> You may eaſily ſee my hatred: when as that famous mountaine <hi>Seir,</hi> where there were ſo many Dukes, as Gen. 36.15. <hi>ad finem,</hi> is now without any dweller, and all the Cities and habitations of them are deſtroyed. Which thing as it is true, and wee doubt not in part the meaning of this place, yet not the whole, becauſe the Lord aimes not ſo much to ſet out his hatred to <hi>Eſau</hi> and his poſterity, as his love to <hi>Jacob</hi> and his: therefore there muſt needs be ſomewhat more in it, that is, the diſſimilitude or diſlike effect, to ſhew his love to them, which riſeth thus: Thoſe whom I love, I keepe them in their countrey, and ſuffer them not to be led captive; yet if for correction I ſuffer the enemy ſo farre to prevaile, I doe againe reduce them into their owne countrey, and give them their owne land, and the comforts of it. On the contrary, thoſe whom I hate, thoſe for their ſinnes I caſt into baniſhment, and never bring home againe: but let their land to be a dwelling for beaſts, Dragons, and ſuch like. Now the former I have done to you who are <hi>Jacobs</hi> poſterity, and the latter to <hi>Eſaus;</hi> now contrary effects have contrary cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. So then as they may ſee in them my hatred, ſo in your ſelves ye may apprehend my love, who are now at home in your
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:151759:29"/>owne Land and Countrey, and enjoy your comforts in your Countrey. This then apparently ſhews his hatred to <hi>Eſaus</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, as in ſpirituall things, the Apoſtle being interpreter, Rom. 9. ſo here in temporall things, and cloſely and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon his love to <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſeed, and to this people.

But yet he muſt doe it with due reſpect and reverence, manifeſting no contempt of their authority.</p>
                        <p>Some will demand: The magiſtrate commands me one thing, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and my parents a contrary, what muſt I doe, whom muſt I obey? It is anſwered, that the magiſtrate muſt be obeyed; for God hath given him a larger Commiſſion then to them, for they themſelves are ſubject, as their children; who neither may doe, nor command contrary to their authority, but doing ſo he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and the ſonne ſinneth in obeying. Againe Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands commonly reſpect common good, and the good that is more common, is more excellent; a common good muſt not be neglected for a private; nor this preferred before it. A mans countrey is to be preferred before his parents, and the goods of it: And to obey them, were not a good thing, for<note n="d" place="margin">Bouum non ſuo loco non eſt bonum.</note> a good thing out of its place, is not good; blood out of the veines in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther veſſels is hurtfull, though in his place the life conſiſt in it. A good thing not done in his place, were better undone, yea it cannot be well done. Moreover, we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the affection and action. A man may love his parents better then the magiſtrate, but he muſt obey him rather; as he may love a good man, better then a great man, yet in many caſes he is not bound to doe ſo much for him. The firſt, becauſe God hath ſhewed his ſpeciall love more to him, then them. The ſecond,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:151759:47"/>becauſe God hath given him a great authority of command. So 'tis in this inward affection, and outward obedience, becauſe the bond of nature is ſtronger in the one, and the force of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is greater in the other. Finally, if the things prejudice the State, they muſt not be obeyed; but if it doe not prejudice the publique good, and be much benefit to a private parent, ſo the ends of the two be regarded, &amp; no contempt of authority ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp; a man be content to abide the penalty; A man may diſobey, and prefer Parents before Magiſtrates without ſinne to God.

For as when children are compelled to match againſt their wills, and where they have juſt occaſion of exception, for ſome ſiniſter reſpect the parents have, there follows much uncleanneſſe and impiety: ſo when without the parents conſent, and not of their providing, but they are their owne chooſers; ſhewing where parents conſent is wanting, there Gods bleſſing is away; yea, where parents conſent is not, there is Gods curſe; as in <hi>Eſau</hi> and his poſterity, in <hi>Judah</hi> taking his Hoaſts daughter, Gen. 38.2. having <hi>Er</hi> and <hi>Onan,</hi> ſuch as God would not endure to live, but ſlew them himſelfe. Yea, that may alſo be ſeene, Gen. 6.2. in the ſonnes of <hi>Seth,</hi> the Church which matched with curſed <hi>Chams</hi> ſeed of themſelves, without parents conſent, had ſuch a wretched poſterity. This thing then is reproofe-worthy, yea, damnable in children without repentance; parents are often cauſes of it; and that firſt, to ſome it is Gods retribution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſo ſerved and abuſed their parents: Secondly, becauſe they give ſuch liberty to their daughters to wander, as <hi>Dinah;</hi> and ſo Ezek. 23.3. <hi>their breſts come to be preſſed, and the teats of their virginity bruiſed:</hi> or elſe their affections by often meeting are ſo intangled and inflamed, as the fathers threats will not looſe it, nor the mothers teares cannot quench it. It was not ſo, Prov. 30.18, 19. it ſhould not be ſo. <hi>Hierom</hi> to <hi>Demetr. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt.</hi> 8.11. would not have Virgins alone, <hi>ſolae ſine matre:</hi> for in a flocke of Doves the Kite often will prey upon one when they are abroad; and it is a ſcabbed ſheep that loves wandring, and leaves the fold.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, becauſe parents doe not take and uſe their right, and provide for them in due time mates fit for them, which makes them provide for themſelves, not without ſinne, but greatly ſinning; yet the parents partakers of it, and oftentimes of much ſhame and griefe, as it was with <hi>Tamar,</hi> Gen. 38.26. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, one mans ſinne cannot excuſe another, nor yet the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents the childs ſinne, nor will not exempt them from the curſe of God, when they thus match to the griefe of their parents, and the ſhortening of their dayes and life, by whom they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

As Uſurers get their fathers inheritance from them by feeding them with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: ſo they muſt not ſet their affections by fervency of ſociety and company upon others, without parents, and where never like to give allowance. They ought to remember this is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers right, to chooſe, to diſpoſe of them, not onely in the generall, but for the particular perſon: But what if he be farre off, and cannot ſee? If he give thee liberty, duely aſking it of him, he hath given his right from himſelfe, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> to <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 28. But what if he upon ſome ſiniſter reſpect, deferre and paſſe the flower of her age? I anſwer; then hath God ordained the Magiſtrate as for their puniſhment, ſo for their reliefe, who is not to be ſought to but when moſt urgent neceſſity requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, when the oppoſition ſtands betwixt Marriage and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, becauſe that reveales the fathers fault, and bewrayes his or her infirmity. But what if he tender a match out of the Church, a Papiſt, or ſuch like? Then muſt the Child refuſe with reverence, not diſpoſing of himſelfe; for as it were ſinne to yeeld, ſo the other is ſinne to make choyce of himſelfe. But what if another that is not ſo religious and ſo fervent a lover of the Truth, as is to be wiſhed? No direct deny all is lawfull, but a wiſe delaying and a diſcreet gaining of time to ſollicite God with their prayers, who hath the heart of their Parents in his hand, and to intreate them by mediation of beſt friends; who if they can be diverted, it is well; if not, I know no warrant a Child hath to deny his fathers choyce, (though he thinke, and it may be he might chooſe better) and he may looke for a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from God, if in duty he thus ſubmit himſelfe to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>

For he that will ſpeake ſo frowardly, and looke ſo ſcornfully and doggedly, as many will, it muſt needs ſhew he hath no reverence, but his heart is full of deſpight and contempt; and he that will ſpeake ſo to his
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:151759:53"/>face, and in his preſence, what will he to others behind his back, and in his abſence? Where is the feare and trembling <hi>Paul</hi> calls for? Where is all the honour <hi>Peter</hi> exacts, when ye will thus bourd them often, thus diſdaine them? when ye will anſwer them frowardly, or murmuring when their backs are turned; when you tell their weakneſſe not to your fellows, but to neighbours ſervants, whereby their eſtimation is impaired. Thinke you the Apoſtles call for theſe in vaine, or ſhall ſuch things goe unpuniſhed? Aſſuredly no: for when the Apoſtle ſaith to ſervants, to encourage them that are good, Eph. 6.7, 8. <hi>with good will doing ſervice, as to the Lord, and not to men; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that whatſoever good thing any man doth, the ſame ſhall he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free;</hi> did he not meane the contrary? and would have you to underſtand, that whatſoever evill thing a man doth, that ſhall he receive of the Lord, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be bond or free? ſo expect it in this particular; ſee then that, unreverent and contemptuous ſervants; expect you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the Lord ſome fearefull thing, and let it be a reſtraint in you of ſuch irreverence in the things ſpoken of, or the like. But of this ſin Maſters are often the cauſes of it, and they that bring it upon themſelves.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, becauſe they have beene ſuch ſervants to their Maſters, and ſo have lived in it ever ſince without repentance; even then when God recompenceth them home, yet they will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their owne ſinne, but are ſtill brawling with their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and ſo it is Gods juſt retribution: whereas if they would repent of that, they ſhould better reforme this, Eccleſ. 7.21, 22. Take no heed to all words that are ſpoken, leſt thou heare thy ſervant curſe thee; for oft-times alſo thy owne heart know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that thou thy ſelfe haſt alſo curſed others. It may be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this, though it carry ſomewhat more: That a Maſter, when his ſervant revileth him, or uſeth him irreverently, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member even this ſentence, to make him penitent and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, becauſe they have remitted of that ancient ſeverity in their government, which we heare men, that can remember times that are paſt, ſpeake of; not having thoſe ſtrait eyes, nor hard hands over them as they ought, not ſo ſharply correcting them as the offence and nature of a ſervant requireth; ſo that they little reverence them, for they feare them not, becauſe they forget that of Prov. 29.19. <hi>A ſervant will not be corrected by words, for though he understand, he will not anſwer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, becauſe they bring them up too liberally for diet and apparrell, and ſo when the belly is full, and the back fine, the Maſter is not ſo regarded. A ſervant is like in this thing to a Horſe full fed and pampered, he will caſt his rider; like to <hi>Buce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:151759:54"/>Alexanders</hi> Horſe; while he was bare-backt he would carry any man; but if once he had his trappings and furniture, none, or hardly <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelfe. It is the complaint of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that ſervants are thus inſolent to themſelves and others; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, though not all, are the cauſes of it themſelves; (ſomewhat there is in the nature of a ſervant and other things) for they bring them up ſo delicately, as Prov. 29.21. <hi>He that delicately bringeth up his ſervant from a child, ſhall have him become his ſonne at the length.</hi> Whatſoever their fare is, their apparrell is farre exceeding; a ſervant going better than a man of his Maſters place and wealth did ſome few yeares agoe. And though they will not allow it themſelves, yet they can be content their friends, or themſelves, if their fortune be allotted unto them, ſhould provide it for themſelves: And if, when they are thus gay without, they uſe them as <hi>Hagar</hi> did her Miſtris, when ſhe was bigge with child, is it not juſt with them? A great cauſe of this, is taking of Apprentices with great portions, and ſo as <hi>Mulier cum dote,</hi> is <hi>imperioſa,</hi> ſo they and their friends. The cauſe you muſt have ſuch portions with them, more than in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, is this, becauſe they muſt thus be maintained, more than in former times. But better it were that you had leſſe, and kept them more meanely; better for you, you ſhould have more reverence and reſpect: better for them, for thus you bring ſin upon them for the preſent, and in future time juſt contempt, as they have contemned you.</p>
                        <p>To perſwade ſervants to uſe their Maſters with all reverence and good reſpect that may be, <label type="milestone">

But here may be moved the ſame doubts and queſtions, which were in the obedience of Children. Firſt, If God and my maſter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand divers things, whom muſt I obey? God, for the reaſons before, and that of Chriſt, Math. 23.8. <hi>one is your maſter, that is Chriſt;</hi> that is chiefe and principall, who muſt firſt and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially be ſerved. But yet thou that are a ſervant, take heed, thou make not an oppoſition, when there is none, yet at leaſt not in thy obedience, though there may be in his command, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſhift off his ſervice, and to eaſe thy ſelf, or for other ſiniſter reſpect; for this know; that thou mayſt doe things at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which happily he commands not lawfully, and which thou couldſt not doe lawfully without his command. Inſtances will make the point more evident; for thee to withdraw thy ſelf on the Lords Sabboth, from publique exerciſes is unlawfull; But thy maſter commands thee to ſtay at home, either whole or part of the day; I ſee not, but thou mayſt doe it, and without ſinne: The maſter may command it without ſinne, if he dwell farre from neighbours, as in the Country, for the preſervation
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:151759:56"/>of the things God hath given him; and if nigh unto neighbors, yet for his children, who either muſt be troubleſome to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, as too many are, and hinder many from hearing, or muſt be kept at home, which cannot be without danger, if ſome one of diſcretion be not with them: here he may lawfully command, and thou lawfully obey, which thou couldeſt not doe without: But he may doe it unlawfully, when he hath no ſuch occaſion, yet thou muſt doe it and may, ſo he imploy thee not about ſervile workes on that day, and in that time: The reaſon is, becauſe the Lords day may beſanctified privately, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique exerciſes are not of abſolute neceſſity in the ſanctifying of it; for then priſoners and ſicke perſons, and ſuch as lye lame, ſhould not be able to ſanctifie it: They onely are of neceſſity, when they can be had without apparent breach of ſome other commandements; and yet maiſt thou make this unlawfull to thee; when if thou be left at home, thy Maſter and Miſtris are gone to Church, but thou art with a child in thy armes, or without gazing at the dore, or gadding abroad, or having thy companions comming to thee, and ſpendeſt thy time prophanely, when thou oughteſt, ſo much as may be, to ſpend it in reading the word, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating on that thou haſt heard in the forenoon or former time, or ſuch like. And in this thou muſt take heed how thou ſetſt God, and thy maſter, one againſt another: another inſtance, thy maſter commands, that is unlawfull for him to bid, not for the thing, but his affection; thou muſt obey, having firſt wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and humbly ſought to turne thy maſter from ſuch a ſinne: As betwixt <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Joabs</hi> numbring of the people, 2 Sam. 24.2, 3. But the thing he commands is unlawfull, as well as his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I meane not ſimply, but by circumſtance or conſequent, yet thou mayſt obey, as being an Officers Clerke to receive more fees then is due, being extortion; or a Noble mans bailiffe his extreame racke rents; providing that in humility thou ſhew thy diſlike of it, ſeeke to reforme it, or doe it with ſorrow and griefe while thou art bound to it, and get thy ſelf rid of ſuch a ſervice ſo ſoone as thou may. But if he command thee any thing ſimply that is ſinne, as to ſweare for his gaine, to lye for his commodity, to deceive, to ſteale, or any ſuch things, thou mayſt not obey, and yet not rebell, but ſuffer.</p>

But if ſome come to this, yet can they hardly ſuffer with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hard meaſure, though they ſuffer deſervedly; when as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall equity condemneth him that doth otherwiſe.</p>
                        <p>And be it, that ſome can thus ſubdue themſelves, yet is it no more than the Heathens and Publicanes will doe: it is but <hi>Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na patientia,</hi> a dog-like enduring, ſaith <hi>Bernard,</hi> ſuch as God will not accept, when either he dare not whine, or hath done ſome foule fact, and deſerved it. But if they have not, or thinke they have not deſerved it, how ready are their anſwers? how ſoone will they turne upon their Maſters, and take the rod by the end? and if they be rebuked, they murmure; if they be corrected, they either will reſiſt, or clamorouſly complaine, or wickedly ſeeke revenge. Let theſe know and ſee their ſin, and looke for a recompence from the Lord; for, ſaith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> they have loſt their thankes, it is not thankes worthy, if they had ſuffered for evill; what when they will not? undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let them looke from God, which rewardeth every man, they ſhall have their recompence from him, if they repent not; it may be in this life with the like, (if not in the life to come) with wicked and lewd ſervants. But of this ſinne, if we may enquire the cauſes of it, we ſhall find in many, to come from the Parents and friends, either in their education, bringing them up cockeringly, never uſing them to reproofes, to the rod, and to the yoke; but as my young Maſters, and ſuch as never ſhould come to ſerve; ſo that when they muſt to it, by no meanes they can apply themſelves unto it, but in it endure and ſuffer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, not ſo much as ſharpe words, but no blowes, deſerved, or not. But this is not all their fault, for it is ſeconded with as bad when they are in ſervice, and find ſome hardneſſe, and as they onely thinke, ſharpneſſe; they remembring the fondneſſe of their affection, complaine to them, who doe not as they ſhould, correct them ſoundly, and ſend them home againe; but
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:151759:57"/>goe to their Maſters, and expoſtulate the matter for them; exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate the fact, aggravate the Maſters hard dealing, upbraid him with what he gave him with his friend or child, and ſo ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate them, that they will be in nothing ſufferers after, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without grudging and repining. Another cauſe is in the maſter, either becauſe he was ſuch, and is ſuch becauſe he hath not repented; and ſo it is Gods retribution, <hi>ut ante;</hi> or becauſe he hath beene too remiſſe to let faults, many and little, eſcape without reproofe and correction, that when he would for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he cannot ſubdue them; or paſſed by ſome greater faults in ſome other of his ſervants for ſome ſiniſter reſpect, as becauſe he would not be accounted cruell and ſevere, which in the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, and the cankred nature of another ſervant is payed him home, becauſe he never feared to be accounted cruell of God, and ſuch an one as hates his ſervant; for that will hold in ſervants, Prov. 13.24. <hi>He that ſpareth his rod, hateth his ſonne; but he that loveth him, chaſteneth him betimes;</hi> and ſo being aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in a licentious and corrupt age to be accounted hard and ſtrait, he hath ſhame laid upon him by a rebellious ſervant, as we may apply, Prov. 29.15. <hi>The rod and reproofe giveth wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but a Child left to himſelfe, bringeth his mother to ſhame.</hi> A third cauſe is in the Magiſtrate, to whom the maſter complains, as he may and muſt in a deſperate cauſe, who by the ſervants friends or meanes he makes to him, will either reprove and checke the maſter, which he ought not to doe, though there be ſome ſmall cauſe; nor, if great cauſe, yet not before the friends or face of the ſervant, and little or not at all reprove, or not ſeverely correct that ſervant, by which not onely he is made more bold againſt his maſter, but even other ſervants are ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated againſt theirs, and the maſters utterly diſcouraged to ſeeke any helpe from them.</p>

Then, as Chriſt, except your righteouſneſſe exceed, &amp;c. ſo except your ſubjection exceed that which a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man will performe, you ſhall have no thanke from God, no reward.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:151759:62"/>and that we have received, one will give him his heart, another his body, not his heart; another will part both with him, as if he created not both as one, as if his title be not as great to one as to another, or to the whole, as to part: He is the Father of our ſpirits, and the Father of our bodies; or if thou wilt give one, and not the other, thou condemneſt thy ſelfe by the one, for with-holding the other; for his right is in this reſpect to both, and muſt have both, and be honoured in the whole. But why pay they as much, becauſe they would receive more, and have not yet enough? So in this no man is perfect, though he have received much. And why hath not God made him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect? Verily it was, as one ſaid, not becauſe he was covetous and niggard, but becauſe he was loving and bountifull, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it was good for him to be ſuch an one; not that he ſhould be poore, but humble; not as alwayes needy, but as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes looking up to him, and remembring to honour him with that he hath given him, that he may receive that he wants, and further perfection: pay then thy debt, and pay it to receive more, that thou mayeſt be perfect, and thinke he ſpeakes to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one; If I be thy Father, honour me; remember me thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth and thy age, even as one ſaith, ſo often as thou breatheſt, ſo often thou oughteſt to remember God.

                        <p>The ſecond thing to be obſerved, is how this child-like and filiall feare differs from the other ſervile feare; and that it doth in divers things.</p>
                        <p>The firſt difference is in reſpect of the object, that is, of that which is feared, that is ſinne; the one feares ſinne as it is ſinne, and becauſe it is ſinne: the other onely the puniſhment of ſin, and not ſinne at all but in regard of the puniſhment; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer curbs the action onely,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Hoſea</hi> 3.5.</note> the other the affection; the one li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and loveth ſinne, but he dare not commit it in regard of the danger that may enſue of it; the other hateth and abhorreth ſinne, and would not commit it though he might doe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger at all, as Prov. 8.13. <hi>The feare of the Lord is to hate evill,</hi> Pſal. 97.10. And becauſe it deales with the affection, it is called <hi>a pure feare;</hi> Pſal. 19.9. <hi>The feare of the Lord is cleane or pure,</hi> for it purgeth the heart, as faith is ſaid to doe, Acts 15.9. The other is a melting feare, but this is a purging and refining feare.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond difference is in their grounds, the one is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded onely uon the wrath of God, and for his juſtice; the other regardeth them, but ſpecially his mercy and goodneſſe, Pſal. 130.4. Hoſea 3.5. The filiall feare, to offend God in regard of benefits paſt; the ſervile, for evill to come: Se ethe difference plainely, Jer. 5.22, 23, 24. <hi>Feare ye not me, ſaith the Lord? or will ye not be afraid at my preſence, which have placed the ſand for the bounds of the Sea by the perpetuall decree that it cannot paſſe it, and though the waves thereof rage, yet can they not prevaile, though they roare, yet can they not paſſe over it? But this people hath an unfaithfull and rebellious heart: they are departed and gone. For they ſay not in their heart, Let us now feare the Lord our God, that giveth raine both early and late in due ſeaſon: he reſerveth unto us the appointed weekes of the harveſt.</hi> If you will nor have this filiall feare, yet at leaſt ſhake not off this ſervile dread, if not feare in regard of good I have, yet of evill I may doe them.</p>
                        <p>By theſe two (for the preſent) may every one examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, whether he hath a ſervile or a filiall feare. If thou feareſt as a Childe, thou hateſt ſinne as ſinne, becauſe it is ſinne, thou art like a man that loaths a meate, and therefore would not eate of it. If only a ſervile feare, thou loatheſt ſinne for the puniſhment, not for it ſelfe indeed, but the ſequel; like a man that hath a minde to eate of ſomething that the Phiſitian hath forbidden him, and is hurtfull, and abſtaines only becauſe he dares not
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:151759:64"/>touch it for feare of further inconvenience. If thou haſt the child-like feare* It is not the outward worke that diſlikes thee, and externall act of ſinne only, but even the deſires,<note place="margin">Iſta ſagitta timor, qui configit &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terficit carnis deſideria. Ber.</note> motions and affections; for it is pure. That dart is feare which pierces and kills the very deſires of the fleſh. If the ſervile onely, then the outward worke onely and practice of ſinne is feared; if a filiall feare, then it will grieve thee to offend, nay, to be provoked to offend ſo good and gracious, ſo mercifull and loving a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who hath beene ever ſo gracious and good unto thee. But if but the ſervile feare, then onely when thou feeleſt his hand, or feareſt an imminent danger, or haſt the freſh remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of a judgment which is but new taken from him, for which a Child of God muſt and ought to feare: but then are not theſe the principall cauſes of feare in him, for theſe he feares, and flies ſin, but principally for the other. If a filiall feare, thou art afraid to offend in lieu of thankfulneſſe, for thy being and preſervation, and all thy manifold bleſſings received already: If a ſervile, onely for feare of evills, or hope of that which is to come. It is the whip, the ſcourge, and the rod that cauſeth the hypocrite as an Aſſe, a foole, and a ſtave to forbeare and leave ſinne; but it is love, conſcience, and obedience that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Gods Children willingly to abhorre it. <hi>Nazianz.</hi> if thou bee'ſt a ſlave and a ſervant, ſtand in feare of the whip or the ſcourge; if an hireling, worke for thy wages, expect thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: but if over and above all theſe, thou beeſt a ſonne, doe good, becauſe it is thy duty to pleaſe and obſerve thy father, from whom thou haſt received ſo much good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                        <p>The third difference of theſe two feares is this; the one is a loving feare, and the other is a hatefull feare; the firſt is joyned with love, ſuch as good ſubjects beare to good Princes, and ordinarily children beare to their fathers. The ſecond is joyned with hatred, ſuch as ſervants beare to their hard and cruell Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; the one would, if they could, withdraw themſelves out of Gods government, and get out of his ſight, as <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 3. as a fugitive ſervant, as <hi>Hagar,</hi> Gen. 16. the other would not willingly away from God, but ſubmitteth himſelfe unto him, and ſeeketh as he can, to preſſe neerer and neerer, as farre as he dare with due reverence of his Majeſty, like the Prodigall ſonne, who came home to his father, and yeelded himſelfe willingly into his hands. And therefore it is a true ſaying, that after ſinne the wicked are troubled, they cannot get themſelves farre enough from God; and the godly are troubled, they can not come neere enough home to him: the one is afraid of the loſing of God, the other is afraid of Gods finding of him: of that, ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in 1 John 4. it is called <hi>caſtus timer,</hi> a chaſte feare.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:151759:65"/>Tis one thing to feare God, leſt he ſend thee to Hell,<note place="margin">Aliud eſt timere Deum ne te mittat in Gehennam, aliud ne ipſe à te recedat ille non eſt caſtus qui non venit ab amore Dei, ſedex timore poenae, iſte caſtus eſt quia venit ex amore Dei quem amlecteris. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> in <hi>1</hi> Joh. <hi>4</hi>
                           </note> another leſt himſelfe depart from thee: that feare is not chaſt, becauſe it comes not from the love of God, but from the feare of puniſhment; but this is chaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it comes from the love of God, whom thou delighteſt in. So that this filiall feare agreeth with the love of Gods Majeſty, yea it riſeth out of love, a man is afrayd to offend one that he loveth, but the ſervile fear is joyned with the deadly hatred of God. And ſo as it is ſaid, whom they feare they hate,<note place="margin">Quem metu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt oderunt, &amp; quem ode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt periiſſe cupiunt.</note> and they deſire he may periſh whom they hate. So it may be ſaid of this, that by it he is not <hi>homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cida,</hi> a manſlayer, but <hi>Deicida,</hi> a Godſlayer, wiſhing there were never a God to puniſh him.</p>
                        <p>The fourth difference of theſe two feares, is in their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which is manifeſt.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, If we conſider them in divers ſubjects, for the one is but for a bront, like lightning that giveth a flaſh and is gone, and comes in an inſtant; never ceizeth upon the ſoule, nor dwelleth in the heart. For inſtance we may take <hi>Pharoah,</hi> Exod. Chap. 27, 28, 29, 30. ſo <hi>Ahab,</hi> when <hi>Eliah</hi> had ſummoned him, hee feares, 1 King. 21.27. but ſoone after he goes feareleſſe to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth Gilead,</hi> 1 King. 22.26, 27. The filiall feare is permanent, and conſtant, as the cauſes of it are, Iſa. 11.2. Prov. 28.14. For it is no naturall worke, but a ſupernaturall habit.</p>
                        <p>Secndly if we conſider them in one ſubject, the one outla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth and overlives the other. 1 Joh. 4.18. <hi>perfect love caſteth out feare;</hi> that is, ſervile feare, but Pſal. 19.9. <hi>The feare of the Lord is cleane, enduring for ever,</hi> that is, filiall feare, when it comes, it caſts out that, becauſe it brings with it aſſurance of God favour. It remaines ſtill, having the leſſe paine and trouble with it the longer it laſteth, and the more forward it commeth to perfection: And this feare is ſo laſting that it remaines after this life; not that the bleſſed ſhall fear either leſt they ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, for they are then without danger of falling; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Gods power, and his incomparable, and his incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible graces, there ſhall be a reverent dread, and yet delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſuch as the Angels have now in Heaven: As Angels feare, Iſaiah 6.2, 3, 4. when they are in the preſence of God; for as we reverence a great man in regard of his place, though he beare us no evill will, nor we expect any evill from him; So no doubt, the holy Saints and Angels in Heaven in regard of God, though they neither feare to loſe him, becauſe they can not fall from him, nor to offend him, becauſe there is no danger to diſpleaſe him, yet they reverence him ſtill in regard of his Majeſty, which they can neither ſufficiently admire nor adore.</p>

                        <p>Now further by theſe two differences, as by the former, may every man examine himſelfe, whether he hath a childelike or ſervile feare.</p>
                        <p>As by the firſt, whether thou loveſt or hateſt God for feare:<note place="margin">Deum tua peccata vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care aut non poſſe, aut nol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, aut ea ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcire, vis ergò Deum non eſſe Deum, qui vis eum aut injuſtum eſſe, aut impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem aut in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientem. Bern. de Temp. <hi>58.</hi>
                           </note> wouldeſt thou flee from God, when thou haſt offended, couldſt thou wiſh he were not? If thou deſireſt that either he knew not thy ſinnes, or could not or would not puniſh them; then thou wouldſt that God were not, when thou deſireſt hee were ignorant, or impotent, or unjuſt: And hence thy wretched heart under this feare even hates God, thou haſt but a ſervile feare; but canſt thou yeeld thy ſelfe to God, and draw neere to him, fearing to be forſaken of God, being willing to yeeld thy ſelf into his hands? this is filiall feare. There is ſayth <hi>Auguſtine</hi> an unchaſte adulterous woman, who feareth her huſband, but ſhe feareth him, becauſe ſhe loveth her naughtineſſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his company is not delighfull, but burthen ſome unto her, and loving evill ſhe is afrayd of his comming, leſt he finde her ſo. There is a chaſte woman, ſhe loveth and affecteth her huſband, and liveth with him in good ſort, and would never have him out of ſight; now aſk them both whether they fear their huſbands? they will ſay they doe; there is the ſame anſwer, but not the ſame minde. Aſke them why? and that will put the difference,<note place="margin">
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>na vox, non eadem mens.</note> the one anſwereth leſt he ſhould come home and finde her, and finde out her lewdneſſe and lightneſſe; the other, leſt being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent he ſhould depart, and leſt he ſhould love her leſſe, and by any offence of hers be eſtranged. As he much miſliketh the former woman, ſo miſlike thy ſelf if thou fear God in that ſort, and carry thy ſelf ſo to God in this ſort, as thou wouldſt thy wife ſhould be affected unto thee.</p>
                        <p>By the ſecond, is thy feare momentany, ſoone come, ſoone gone, doeſt thou not feare awayes? then feare thy feare it is not true. If thou haſt overcome thy ſervile feare, and doſt not feare ſtill, thou canſt not have true feare; for as love expels one feare and caſts it out, ſo it cauſeth another, and that ſuch a feare as is never afterwards extinguiſhed, though the act &amp; working of it be ſomtime more freſh then others, yet the habit is never loſt.</p>
                        <p>The third thing touching this filiall feare is the effects of it. And theſe I reduce to theſe heads, ſuch as awfull and dutifull children have, and ſo may well be ſo reſembled.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is a deſire to know his will and pleaſure, to finde it out, and a delight in doing of it: As a child will be deſirous to know his fathers minde, that he may not offend him, and be ready to doe it of himſelfe when he hath found it; hence that Pſal. 112.1. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth the Lord, that deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth greatly in his commandements.</hi> See it by the contrary, Job. 21.9, 14 <hi>Their houſes are ſafe from feare, neyther is the rod of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:151759:66"/>them; Therefore they ſay unto God, depart from us: for we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not the knowledge of thy wayes.</hi> Pſal. 25.12, 13. <hi>What man is he that feareth the Lord? him ſhall he teach in the way that he ſhall chuſe; his ſoule ſhall dwell at eaſe, and his ſeed ſhall inherit the Earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſecond is, a ſuſpition and jelouſy of particular actions, leſt they ſhould doe that unawares, which might be offenſive to God. A good childe, if he doubt to doe ought that he thinketh his father will not like of, he will firſt aſke the queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will have him doe it or no, and let it alone till he know his minde in the matter: ſo a childe of God, he will be carefull to try all his workes by his will and his word, and to abſtaine till he know what his good will, and his pleaſure is. Thus was <hi>Job</hi> zealous of his children, Job. 1.5. ſo of his owne wife, Job. 9.28. Therefore the ſpirit commends him for a man fearing God, and ſuch as none was like, yea as the devill could finde no fault with him, Rom. 14.5. he will be fully perſwaded it is Gods will, before he doe it. 1 Theſſal. 5.21. not enough to ſay, I doe not know it unlawfull; better debarrre our ſelves of ſome lawfull things, then doe one unlawfull. Eccleſ. 5.5, 6.</p>
                        <p>The third is, a wary ſhunning and avoyding of things he knows will offend, as an awfull child will hardly be drawn, or woed to do ought that his father hath expreſſely forbidden him, or that will diſpleaſe him; as <hi>Jacob</hi> to lye and deceive his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Gen. 27. or if he be drawn, yet if his father come ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon him, and finde him about it or beginning it, he will ſtay his hand ſoone and bee aſhamed of himſelfe: ſo the man that feares God, will not be woed and urged to thoſe things that he knoweth cannot but offend God. So <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 39.9. <hi>There is none greater in his houſe then I: neither hath he kept back any thing from mee but thee, becauſe thou art his wife; how then can I doe this great wickedneſſe and ſinne againſt God?</hi> Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah 5.15. <hi>The former governours that had been before mee, were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides forty ſhekels of ſilver, yea even their ſervants bare rule over the people, but ſo did not I, becauſe of the feare of God.</hi> Or if by caſe of infirmity or ſtrength of temptation he be violently car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away, yet if he ſhall but once ſeriouſly thinke of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God about him, it will make him for ſhame to ſtay, or breake off the practice of ſinne, as in <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 24.10. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids <hi>heart ſmote him, and he ſaid, I have done very fooliſhly.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The fourth is, a griefe and a feare to ſee ought done by others that may provoke God to wrath, as a good childe will be loath any of his brethren or any of the ſervants ſhould doe ought that may anger his father, if it be but the diſquieting of him: ſo a true child of God will be vexed to ſee others take ſuch courſes as
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:151759:66"/>may be offenſive to his heavenly father. So that 2 Pet. 2.7. and <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.53.136.139.158. ſuch are commended and marked, Ezechiel 9. as they are condemned, 1 Cor. 5.1. who doe contrary.</p>
                        <p>The fifth, a trembling at the wrath and anger of God decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for ſinne either in word or deed.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, in word at Gods threatnings either againſt him ſelfe or others, as a child quaketh and trembleth at his fathers chyding, though it be with ſome others; ſo doe the children of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly when they heare the wrath of God, denounced againſt others, ſo is it, Iſa. 66.2. Pſal. 119.161. 2 Chro. 34.27. Jer. 26 18. Habacuk. 3.16.</p>
                        <p>Now ſecondly, if at his word, how much more at his rod; if when he ſpeaks, more when he beats themſelves, or others: as a child if he ſee his father to take the rod in hand to correct any of the family, he ſtandeth trembling, and quaking, he feareth leſt he ſhould have a wipe by the way; ſo the child of God feareth as before Gods face, when he ſeeth the hand of God upon others, as when he feeleth it upon himſelfe, <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 6.7.9. the Church, Acts. 5.11. Pſal. 119.119, 120. Habacuk. 3.16.</p>
                        <p>Now theſe being the effects, and as it were the fruits of this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liall feare, it ſhall be good for a man to examine himſelf by them, whether he have it, or no; for by the fruits you ſhall know it: It is to be feared that if men will doe this ſeriouſly, but a few of thoſe who call God father every day, wilbe found to have this filiall feare, and ſo his ſonnes indeed. The firſt fruit, is a deſire to know, and finde out Gods will, and then to doe it; but alas how many have wee that refuſe to ſeek after the knowledge of his wayes; like thoſe, Job. 21.14. but ſay ſome will ſearch the word, yet it is onely to furniſh themſelves with matter of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and not to finde out that which may ſerve, to order and direct their lives; they are a curious kinde of Men, and as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, <hi>scholae non vitae diſcitur;</hi> they ſtudy ſchoole quirks, and not points of practice, others are ſorry many times, that they lighted on more then they looked after: As the yong man not anſwered to his mind, was ſorry he had aſked; Luke 15.25. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath obſerved of his expereince, <hi>Cant. ſer.</hi> 74. many (ſaith he) have I known, made ſad upon the knowledge of the truth, becauſe they could not ſo pretend ignorance as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ber.</hi> in Cant. ſerm. <hi>74.</hi>
                           </note> Or if not this, but with the ſonne in the Goſpell ſtay, and doe not, or deferre as <hi>Jonah,</hi> or doe as <hi>Balaam,</hi> bleſſe, when he would have curſed; ſo they, their hands go againſt their hearts; theſe, and ſuch like, muſt needs be voyd of this feare.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond is a jealouſie over his particular actions; but how many runne headlong into all actions, never regarding what
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:151759:67"/>warrant they have for them; that though never ſo many make doubt of them, and the lawfulneſſe of them, yet all is one to them, as they know nothing for them, ſo they know nothing againſt them: and they eyther doe as <hi>Peter,</hi> Luke 22.49.50. who cut off <hi>Malchus</hi> eare before he could heare his anſwer; or as Prov. 20.25. <hi>doe things firſt, and examine them after.</hi> Theſe are farre from this feare; for where it is, there if any doubt ariſe about an action that ſeemed indifferent before, he will be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of himſelfe, and walke the ſureſt way, when he knoweth he may doe or abſtaine without offence, but he is in ſome ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of the other, he will rather be ſure to goe on a good ground, than hazard the incurring of Gods diſpleaſure, though he loſe ſomewhat, yea much, both of his profit and pleaſure, knowing the feare of God is oppoſite to this manner of wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and ſo 'tis made. Eccleſ. 5.1, 5, 6.</p>
                        <p>The third is a carefull avoiding of knowne ſinnes, and things that will offend; but how many give liberty to their fleſh, runne with a full ſwinge into the practice of ſinne, and never care to returne out of it againe; who vaunt of this feare, and yet often vaunt of their ſinnes, and never ſhame at them. Nay, ſooner ſhame and bluſh to be a man noted, to have a care to avoid the common ſinnes of the age; how have theſe men any child-like feare? will they account that their children doe lovingly feare them, when they runne into all or many things they know will diſpleaſe them, and are aſhamed to be accounted more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily dutifull? Queſtionleſſe no; then let them be their own Judges, and ſhall; for they tell us, they have no feare, if that be their feare. Prov. 8.13.</p>
                        <p>The fourth is a griefe to ſee others offend, but many boaſt of the feare of God, and yet they delight and take pleaſure in the ſight and hearing of other mens ſinnes, never caring nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding what others doe, ſo they be not like them. They can dayly ſee many <hi>Laodiceans</hi> neither hot, nor cold, amongſt us; many <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that have loſt their firſt love; many Jebuſites, Idolaters amongſt us, and ſwarming amongſt us; theſe they ſee, and yet they ſigh not at it; nay, either take pleaſure or make profit by it: it is but a boaſt, they are void of the filiall feare of God, becauſe they have no care whether he be honoured or diſhonoured; pleaſed, or diſpleaſed; as if a Child could endure his fathers diſhonour, if not be revenged of them, for want of power and ſuch like, yet will he mourne and ſorrow. How ſhould I beare my fathers diſhonour? and if theſe, much more thoſe who ſeeke to draw others to ſinne, ſwearing, whoring, drunkenneſſe, and ſuch like; they can have no true feare of God as Children.</p>
                        <p>The fifth, trembling at his judgments threatened or executed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:151759:67"/>upon others. Many ſay they feare God, and yet they can heare the wrath and judgments of God denounced againſt ſinne, and it may be the ſinnes they practiſe, yet are never a whit moved at all, but goe as they came, as if the Word were but wind: As jer. 5.13. Their hearts melt not, nor they mourne not; nay, when they ſee Gods judgments upon others, they cenſure and condemne them, but feare nothing themſelves; nay, often when they are in the ſame condemnation, if they be not in the ſame puniſhment. Sure it is, they have no child-like feare at all, they are worſe than the beaſts, yea, ſenſeleſſe things, who tremble at his voice; and they ſhew themſelves Children of wrath: <hi>Onely the children of wrath are feareleſſe of wrath,</hi>

                           <hi>If I be a Maſter, where is my feare.]</hi> The application of the ſecond rule of nature; we muſt ſpeak of Gods Lordſhip, then of the feare he requires for it: He is a Lord in reſpect of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, either generally or ſpecially: Firſt, generally, <hi>jure Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ationis &amp; gubernationis,</hi> by right of Creation and government. Secondly, particularly, <hi>jure pacti &amp; redemptionis,</hi> by right of Covenant and Redemption. Firſt, <hi>jure redemptionis,</hi> Exod. 20.2. 1 Cor. 6.20. Secondly, <hi>jure pacti &amp; conventionis,</hi> by right of Covenant and agreement. Thoſe who live in his Church, have made <hi>a Covenant with him by ſacrifice,</hi> Pſal. 50. and have bound themſelves by Oath to ſerve him, and have covenanted to be <hi>his people,</hi> Jer. 40. Here he meanes both, but not of the whole in both, but onely of government and covenant: for the other in the former, and by theſe he challengeth obedience and ſervice, as by the former; for that which is required under ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, is here under feare; the ſame thing, but differing in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and ſome circumſtances, as before. But firſt of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and juriſdiction, in reſpect of his bleſſings and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>Men, in reſpect of Gods government over them, <label type="milestone">

                           </label> ought to ſerve and obey him, being under him as ſubjects are under their Lords and Princes, by whoſe authority and Lawes they enjoy their lives and liberties, increaſe in ſtate and riches. So under God; he preſerving, protecting, increaſing them and their ſtates himſelfe. If I be a Maſter and Lord, and you enjoy theſe things by me, where is my ſervice and obedience? This is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by, Iſaiah 1.2, 3. That of the devill in accuſing <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 1.9, 10. ſhews that Gods government requires this; and his anſwer to his wife, Chap. 2.10. alſo ſhews it. That of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 71.6. is pertinent, and that of Jer. 5.24.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe this is not leſſe benefit than the former of Creation; <label type="milestone">

                           </label> for that was once done, this is alwayes; and as it were every day, after a ſort, God creates man anew; ever preſerving that he
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:151759:68"/>once created, ſhewing in this no leſſe power nor love than in the other; and if for that obedience is debt, for creating in a moment; how much more for a continuall preſervation?</p>
                        <p>This may admoniſh all men, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                           </label> that as their Creation before, ſo their continuall preſervation under Gods government, his Lordſhip, and Dominion over them, requires all the ſervice an obedience they can performe, becauſe they are his ſubjects and ſervants, he their Maſter and Lord. All Soveraignes and Lords looke for all feare and obedience from ſuch as they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne, protect, and whoſe good and peace they procure: All Maſters from ſervants they feed, and cloath, and governe; and this they yeeld unto them, how much more all men to God, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, their Soveraigne, and Lord of all, and over all? Therefore all, high and low, Kings and Subjects, Male and Female, bond and free, rich and poore, owe this to him, and are bound unto him for it. For Kings rule, the great ones governe, the rich proſper, the poore live by him, yea, all are under him; he preſerveth and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth all. Whatſoever priviledge one man hath above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet there is no priviledge in reſpect of God. If the King reigned without him, if the Noble ruled without him, if the rich increaſed without him, it were ſomewhat; but when none of theſe, all is by his providence, and from his power, which makes him ſay to all, If I be a Maſter or Lord, where is my feare? The King is great but in reſpect of his ſubjects, nothing greater in reſpect of God than another; as the earth is but a ſmall mote or point in reſpect of the Heavens: the rich are weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy in reſpect of the poore, but, but poore compared with the Kings treaſure, more poore compared with God: ſo that be they all great, and as high and as rich as may be, yet their Crownes and Crownets, their honours and riches, their ſtates and lives are in his hands. And as a Ship in one day upon the Sea would periſh without a governour, ſo would all theſe in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment come to nought without him, his government, protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and providence. See then how every one that acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God his Lord and Maſter, and feeleth indeed his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and providence for good, ought to ſerve and feare him. If thou doeſt not beleeve that God moves all thy members when thou doeſt move, thou art not worthy the name of a Chriſtian, ſaith one; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught it, Acts 17.28. But if thou doeſt beleeve it, that thou receiveſt ſuch from him, and yet dareſt provoke and offend him, I know not what name is evill enough for thee: ſo for this, if thou acknowledge not all is from God, through his providence, and from his care, that thou art as thou art, thou art not worthy the name of a ſonne or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: but if thou acknowledge it, and yet ſhakeſt off his feare,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:151759:68"/>and performeſt not obedience to him, what name is bad enough for thee? nay, what puniſhment is ſufficient for ſuch an offence? what then, if for life and continuance, how much more for a well and wealthy being? when mens portions are made fatter, and their ſtate better, both than in former times, and alſo than thouſand others; Gods providence and care more to them, their obedience and ſervice ſhould be more to him. And yet it is a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable thing, my eyes could caſt out teares for it in ſecret, (as the Prophet) to ſee many men riſen of nothing, when they had little, were diligent and carefull to ſerve and obey God in themſelves, and in their families, and thoſe who belong to them; but after that Gods government was more good to them, and they proſpering better by it, I know not how, ſuch is the corruption of our nature, they ſerve him now farre leſſe in them and theirs; and yet it is thought excuſable, as if a Subject, who lived under his King, and that onely lived without wealth, or honour, or advancement, or but with a ſmall pittance of theſe, and then gave him ſervice and all loyall duty, ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when he had received theſe in bountifull meaſure, by his gracious bounty and government, either leſſe reſpect him, or be leſſe loyall, or more rebellious, and thinke it were tolerable enough, becauſe he is now more wealthy, worſhipfull, and honourable. But whatſoever he thinks, others would condemne him, and every of theſe who deale thus with God; then ſhall they be judged by their owne mouth. Oh that they wuld in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed judge themſelves, that they be not judged of the Lord, 1 Cor. 11.31. elſe undoubtedly he will judge them, if his; in this life puniſhing them in thoſe things which have made them by their corruption leſſe loyall unto him, as wealth, riches, honour, friends, and ſuch like; that he may ſo bring them home againe, and let them ſee how they have wronged him, for great things giving him leſſe. If he done not, the caſe is more fearefull, he meanes to condemne them with the world. And though they will not now acknowledge they injure God any wiſe in thus dealing outwardly with him, yet the day ſhall come, and it is now at hand, when this injury ſhall be made manifeſt, and when as theſe complaints, which are now made by us, ſhall be heard, though men have now their eares ſo heavy, and their eyes ſo ſhut up, and their hearts ſo fat, that they cannot ſee, or heare, or underſtand to be converted and healed: It ſhall (ſaith one) be equall and right with God, that thoſe who will not now open their eyes when there is time, and while the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of bleſſings they enjoy by Gods gracious government, doth invite them to ſerve and feare him; yea, I ſay it ſhall be juſt and right that their eyes ſhall be opened by the multitude of torments, which muſt continue for ever.

For being able he may, when he will, come upon them and deſtroy them, but being willing and not able, he cnnot at his will; ſo in reaſon ought all men to deale with God, and towards him.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe his juſtice will not ſuffer him to paſſe over the breach of his law unpuniſhed, <label type="milestone">

                        <p>Then in the Church muſt there be feare of God, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> namely of his juſtice and power, and not of his mercy only; contrary to ſome who thinke, in the Church, onely men ſhould feare God for his goodneſſe? I anſwer, that it is true this ſhould be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall thing for which they ſhould feare; but in the Church, though we be all one mans ſervants, yet we are not all one mans children; yet if all were ſo, becauſe of the unregenerate part this ought to be, in that a man is not altogether freed, and made a ſonne, but is partly a ſervant, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Then ought every one in the Church to endeavour to know his power and juſtice, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> and to acknowledge them; for howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is true that all are alike in the hand of God, and his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over all, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes, yet all doe not regard and take notice of it. A great many doe not beleeve, nor are perſwaded of them, and that maketh them, they feare not God as they ſhould. For as <hi>Ignoti nulla cupido,</hi> there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of that which is unknowne ſo <hi>nulla formido,</hi> there is no feare; for feare riſeth not ſo much out of the outward evill, as it doth of the inward apprehenſion of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not the neerneſſe of the danger, but the conceit of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:151759:70"/>raiſeth the affection of feare in the heart; therefore <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith of ſome, that they goe downe laughing to Hell, they play merrily upon Hells mouth, as the Child without feare, playeth uon the Cockatrices den, becauſe they are ignorant what danger they are in. So then it is not all who are in his power, and over whom his authority and juſtice is, but ſuch as know them for preſent, or how they may feele them after, that feare and ſtand in awe of him as they ſhould.</p>
                        <p>To teach men, if they have not the ſpirit of ſonnes, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> the love of God and righteouſneſſe, that for conſcience they will obey, yet at the leaſt, that they endeavour to obey him for feare of his power and juſtice, as ſervants, if not as ſonnes. The other is that which is acceptable, yet this is that which God calls for, and men ought to doe, even the outward act of Gods ſervice for feare of his power and juſtice. Though I cannot ſay it hath any promiſes of good things, yet hath God ſhewed good, and given bleſſings to thoſe which have it onely. As to <hi>Ahab</hi> and the <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> for their repenting at the feare of his judgments and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: To ſhew how he will much more accept the repentance of his, yea, and to draw on ſuch ſervants to the like, for that is a ſpeciall benefit to his Church, they be orderly in the outward duty.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond thing concerning this ſervile feare, is the effects of it, which are theſe:</p>
                        <p>The firſt, that it is <hi>tanquam fraenum ad equum,</hi> as a bit and a bridle to men, to with-hold them from ſinne, from the wilfull practice of wicked things; it is the ſtrongeſt curbe that can be to keepe mans corrupt nature from running forth into outrage, if it be ſurely ſetled once in them. Manifeſt in <hi>Laban,</hi> when he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued after <hi>Jacob:</hi> Gen. 31.29. And that of <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the want of this maketh the open high-way to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all ſinne, Rom. 3.18. And that this ſhould be ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, it ſtands with reaſon; becauſe there are two maine things which draw men to ſin, and the practice of wickedneſſe. The firſt is, the deſire of ſome good men may get by the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it, but this deſire is croſſed by feare, which is the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt violent affection of all others, and ſo ſtoppeth the paſſage of all other deſires; ſo that it is neither profit nor plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that can make a timorous man hardy, or can maſter and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome feare in any mans minde, but it will overcome all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of them, and nodeſire of it; nay, not the pleaſure it ſelfe, all the pleaſure in the world cannot comfort a condemned perſon, nor baniſh feare out of his minde, ſo long as the halter hangeth over his head, ſo long as he dayly and hourely looketh to be drawne to execution. But feare is able to expell pleaſure, and the deſire of thoſe things we love moſt; as in <hi>Sampſon</hi> in <hi>Dali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laes</hi>
                           <pb n="112" facs="tcp:151759:71"/>lap, when a noiſe of Philiſtims and a falſe Alarum was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. Gods feare expells all other feares, as is manifeſt by the Midwives. Exod. 1.17. Jer. 1.17. Iſaiah 8.12, 13. As a ſtronger nayle drives out a leſſe, ſo the feare of God other feares; the greater feare the leſſe, the feare of Hell-fire will carry the maſtery of all other feare. Luke 12.4, 5.</p>
                        <p>We may make uſe of this, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> firſt, to prove many men amongſt us not onely void of a filiall feare, which makes men avoid ſmall ſinnes, and to ſhun the act of any ſinne, but of this ſervile feare, becauſe great ſinnes are ſmall or no ſinnes with them, and they have the very habite of all ſinne, living in the practice of ſome one, or many groſſe and impious ſinnes, whoredome, adultery, murther and blood, oppreſſion and cruelty, covetouſneſſe and uſury, ſwearing and blaſphemy, &amp;c. ſo that whatſoever they ſay, we may ſay, Pſal. 36.1. <hi>The tranſgreſſion of the wicked ſaith within my heart, that there is no feare of God before his eyes:</hi> when as then men goe on in their wicked courſes, and a ſmall pleaſure or deſire of it will carry them to the fulfilling of the luſts of the fleſh, and to all voluptuouſneſſe, and practice of all pleaſure, a ſmall feare make them commit any ſinne, and either coveting ſome pleaſure, or thinking to avoid ſome diſpleaſure of the world, they onely neglect not the good, but make no bones to commit ſin, and to lye in it; they have not certainly come ſo farre as to have this ſervile feare, and ſo they are not ſonnes, no not ſervants of God: nay, though they have the ſhape of men, as <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> had, yet they have not ſo much underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a beaſt, leſſe than he had. For as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>Diverſ.</hi> 12. Let us lade and over-burthen an Aſſe, and toyle him with labour, he cares not, becauſe he is an Aſſe: but if we aſſay to put him into the fire, or thruſt him into a Ditch or Quarry, he ſhunneth all he can, becauſe he loves life, and feareth death. And yet theſe run headlong to Hell, and breake forth into all kind of impiety, as the Horſe into the battaile, when they know theſe will worke their everlaſting confuſion.</p>
                        <p>This may teach every man who would keepe himſelfe free from the practice and trade of ſinne, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> and that neither the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures nor diſpleaſures of the world, the delights nor the dreads of it, ſhall draw him to be enticed, and openly ſinne: to labour for this feare, by which he ſhall be able to overcome temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on all ſides. For if he have this feare, a man would never ſell himſelfe to eternall torments for a draught of pleaſure, or for a Million of Gold, when it might be ſaid to him, as Joſhua 22.18. <hi>Ye alſo are turned away this day from the Lord: and ſeeing yee rebell to day againſt the Lord, even to morrow he will be wroth with all the congregation of Iſrael.</hi> Loe, to day he offendeth, and to morrow God will be wroth, and he ſhall periſh in his wrath,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:151759:71"/>ſurely no profit or pleaſure tendered unto him, would make him incurre this danger. And for the other temptation, hee would eaſily overcome it by this, even the feare of mens feare, with the feare of Gods puniſhments, and ſay happily as <hi>David,</hi> though he ſpoke it more ſanctifiedly, Pſal. 119.161. <hi>Princes have perſecuted me without cauſe, but mine heart ſtood in awe of thy words.</hi> If he have this feare, hardly ſuch temptations will aſſault him. For as <hi>Chryſoſt. Hom.</hi> 15. <hi>ad pop. Ant.</hi> If it be once knowne and heard that an armed Souldier ſtands watching in a houſe for the defence of it, there is neither thiefe nor robber, nor any that practiſeth ſuch evill, will come neere it. So, when feare is the keeper of mans heart, there is neither the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of pleaſure, or profit, or worldly feare will ſet upon a man, but will fly away, or be eaſily expelled, ſubdued as it were by the command of feare. God hath ſet two Schoole-maſters o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, <hi>Pudor &amp; Timor;</hi> ſhame and feare; that ſhould lead an ingenuous nature; but if not that, yet this ſhould, unleſſe we will be worſe than beaſts.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond effect of this feare is, that it is <hi>tanquam acus ad filum,</hi> the needle or the briſtle to the threed: that is, that as they goe before, and make way for the threed, but abide not there when it is once come, but goes out againe: So this feare firſt entereth the heart of man, and makes way for love or the Child-like feare, that loving feare, firſt when he is converted; and it entereth in for this end, to bring or draw in love after it, and love when it is once entered, caſteth feare out of doores, that made entrance before. 1 John 4.18. This is further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by the example of <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 9.3, 6. and <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 Chron. 34.19, 27. ſo Act. 2.37, 38. and 16.30. Rom. 7.10.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe God reſpects and accepts men to give them grace when they are troubled, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> and are ſmitten with this feare, Iſaiah 66.2. and it is ſpoken <hi>excluſivè,</hi> none but them; this then muſt needs goe before.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe mans heart is not capable of grace without this; firſt, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> without this it is not fit to receive the impreſſion of Gods Spirit. It gives no grace, but it makes capable of grace; as we ſee fire, though it give the metall no faſhion, yet it maketh it liquid, and fit to be caſt in any mould; it maketh the waxe fit to receive any impreſſion of the Seale. So this feare, though it worke no grace in the heart, but leaveth it as corrupt as it findeth it, yet it mollifieth it, and maketh it plyable for Gods Spirit to worke upon, which before could not take the ſtamp of Gods grace.</p>
                        <p>This manifeſteth that many men muſt needs be without grace, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> becauſe many have not had this feare, which is ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore grace, whereſoever it comes; and grace never comes any where, where this Uſher hath not beene before; it is the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:151759:72"/>of grace, as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was of Chriſt: As God appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Elias,</hi> ſo he approacheth to the ſoule, 2 Kings 19, 12, 13, 14. he was neither in the winde, nor earthquake, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the earth, and clave the rockes, nor in the fire that devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all before it, nor he went not before them; but he was in a ſoft voyce which came afterwards: So is the ſpirit and grace of God, it goes not before the ſervile feare, it is not with it, when it rends the hard hearts of men, and when it melts and mollifies them with the fire of Gods wrath; but it cometh after, and ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth peace and reſt to the ſoule, whereas many never taſted of this feare, and ſhew it by their lives they have no feare of God, nay in words brag, they had never no ſuch rentings, and mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of heart, nay jeſt at thoſe which have, they ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, voyd of grace, of true grace; yea, many who are not ſo outragious, but civill, or rather ſecure, who indeed never felt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch trouble, and fight in them, any ſuch feare or terror, but all things is, and ever was at peace within, they are men voyd of true grace and ſaving grace; they may have the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and ſimilitudes of grace, but no ſubſtance and truth of it.</p>
                        <p>This may teach every man that hath this feare in him, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> to make much of it and nouriſh it, it being the forerunner of grace, and as it were the harbinger of it, without which it never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, as God never comes with grace, unleſſe this apparitor go before; as men therefore who deſire the Prince, and joy in his comming, will rejoyce at the comming of his Harbinger, and make much of him, ſo ought they of this feare; yea, and the greater this feare is, the more rejoyce at it, aſwell as men may rejoyce in feare, for the greater grace follows after, for in the examples of the Scriptures, thoſe who have had moſt feare and conflicts in their converſion, have been the beſt men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, moſt full of grace. God (ſaith <hi>Bernard</hi>) hath two feet, the one of feare, the other of love; and when he would enter a mans Soule, he is wont to ſend afore, or ſtep firſt in with his foot of feare, then after, his foot of love; and the greater the feare is, which went before, the greater the love is which follows after.</p>
                        <p>The third effect of this feare is, to make the party it poſſeſſeth credulous, apprehending every ſurmiſe againſt him, making him encline to the worſt, and forecaſt the utmoſt of the evill. As in that feare which the Goaler was poſſeſt with, Acts 16.27. he apprehended the worſt and utmoſt. In Samuel and Joſiah, ſo in the Ninevites, Ion. 3.5. therefore it made them appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the worſt, and beleeve it would be ſo.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe feare brings to minde a mans ſinnes and deſerts, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> even thoſe which were long before committed, and for them makes
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:151759:72"/>him apprehend danger, and deeper then indeed it is. As in the brethren of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 42.21. no marvell then, if it make them eaſily beleeve that ſuch things may fall upon them.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe they know by themſelves, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> that thoſe who are inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and offended, doe hate the offenders, and where hatred is joyned with power and might, there muſt needs be danger of ſome fearefull effect, and ſo makes them ſuſpect the worſe; It is ſo betwixt man and man, Gen. 50.15. So betwixt man and God.</p>
                        <p>This teacheth us that undoubtedly there is a great want of this feare amongſt moſt, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> becauſe they doe not apprehend or beleeve the dangers imminent, or as great as they be; but if a little, yet they will not make the worſt, but the beſt of every thing. They read often the judgements of God written; they heare them threatned againſt particular ſinnes, and it may be their owne; they ſee them executed upon particular men daily, every moment, and every morning he drawes forth his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet they hang in ſuſpence, whether he will doe with them, as they ſee him doe with others before them: They have the root of gall and bitterneſſe, Deut 29.18, 19. How many ſcoffers have we, who will not beleeve that Hell fire is ſo hot as the preacher tels them; no Hell but in this life, the gall of the conſcience, which they can cure with company, and good fellowſhip. How many have we that thinke the mouth of God is not ſo hot againſt ſinners as men ſpeake of, not ſo grievous as we would make them beleeve; and though now and then ſome be ſmitten, yet that he muſt for example ſake, to keepe ſome more orderly; but no great feare there needs be of it, ſo long as a man is not outragious? how many that think repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is not ſo difficult, as men would make it, for at their deaths for a little confeſſion and proclaiming of their ſorrow, they ſhall have a fellow pronounce pardon unto them; how many thinke that death is not ſo ſuddaine, and ſo uncertaine as ſome imagine, few dye ſo, and that they need not much ſuſpect, and feare to be prepared, but they ſhall have time enough: And for a little good at their death, they heare many Preachers not tell of the ſinnes of men in their lives, for that will not be born, but of their good at their deaths, and include every bodies ſoule in Heaven. But theſe men are all voyd of this feare, for if they had it, they would be eaſily perſwaded of theſe things in their Soules; yea, they would ſuſpect farre more then we could ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, for ſo ſuſpitious is feare: and as every affection is prone to the apprehenſion of thoſe things, that feed that affection; as love, joy, hatred, &amp;c. So ſpecially if feare.</p>
                        <p>Particularly, every man may try himſelfe, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> whether hee hath this feare or no. Is he like to the ſonnes in law of <hi>Lot,</hi> when
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:151759:73"/>their father told them how that God would deſtroy Sodome, Gen. 19.14. <hi>Hee ſeemed to them as one that mocked;</hi> So when the Miniſters threat particular or generall judgements, he is but as one that mockes, and becauſe of Gods patience after their Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and denouncing, thou thinkſt nothing will come; but ſay, as ſome have been heard ſpeaking, the Miniſters doe well to threaten ſharpely, and ſpeake great words, and tell the people of fearefull things, but yet we hope for farre better things, feare thy ſelfe, becauſe thou canſt not feare the things they ſpeak, and believe them, much leſſe apprehend more, never caſting the worſt, but making the beſt of every thing: this ſecurity argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that thou wanteſt this ſervile feare.</p>
                        <p>The fourth effect of this feare is humility; for feare beates downe the pride of the heart, and makes men not ſtand upon their pantofles, man to man, not to ſtand upon tearmes, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Benhadad</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 Kings 20.31, 32. ſo in this where the feare of Gods power is, the former examples of Ninevites, Iſraelites, <hi>Saul, Goaler,</hi> ſheweth it plainly, as that Rom. 11.20. <hi>Bee not high minded, but feare:</hi> a proud ſpirit and the feare of God can never agree.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe they know there is no wiſdome nor power againſt the Lord, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> and ſo he is to be crept to, not held at defiance; for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wiſdome teacheth thoſe who are in danger of others, and under their power, when they know their power and juſtice, not to carry themſelves proudly, but humbly towards them. As in <hi>Benhadad:</hi> ſo women and friends, who ſue to Judges for their friends, doe petition them ſubmiſſely. <hi>Chryſoſtom.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Becauſe it will make every man out of love and liking with all things he hath, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> and to take no joy in them, or at leaſt no pride in them, when he feares his power who can take them from them in a moment.</p>
                        <p>This, as the former, ſheweth that many men are deſtitute of this feare, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> they are ſo highly minded, they ſtand ſo upon their tearmes, and prerogatives, in moſt things, not with men but God, not in ſmall things but matters of ſalvation. They ſtand upon their reputation and eſteem amongſt men, when as God cals up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſounds an Alarum, not to the eare by us, but to their heart and conſciences with us, calling them out of their courſe of life, as their ambitious, lying, deceitfull, covetous or carnall, civill courſe, and ſubmit themſelves to the word &amp; to the means of ſalvation, forſaking ſuch courſes, and living humbly, dealing plainly, walking contentedly, having religious and holy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, they fear men will mock &amp; ſcorn at them, &amp; think mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of them, ſay they are become ſuperſtitious, or turned preciſe, or they cary themſelves otherwiſe then becometh men of their place and ſtate, like <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> Jer. 38.19. Like thoſe rulers, who
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:151759:73"/>beleeved on Chriſt, but of a proud and ambitious humour, they were aſhamed to profeſſe him. John 12.42, 43. They thought it too baſe a matter to yeeld themſelves to be governed by ſo meane a man, as had none almoſt but a few Fiſhermen to follow after him; ſo ſtanding upon the reputation of their eſtate and places, they refuſed to ſubmit themſelves to the meanes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and continued in their damned eſtate. How many have we like to theſe in all places, Cities, Townes, Villages, houſes, all full of them; as many as there are, ſo many have we, that yet have not this ſervile feare.</p>
                        <p>Particularly, every man may try himſelfe whether he hath this feare or no: <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> where this <hi>Timor</hi> is, there is not <hi>Tumor,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard;</hi> there this feare hath pierced that bladder, and let out all the wind in it; thou art growne humble and lowly, and ſtandeſt not upon the reputation or eſtimation of men, ſo thou may'ſt doe what God commands when he calls to any duty; but if thou doeſt, there is no feare in thee. For inſtance, thou haſt in the time of thy ignorance or prophaneneſſe, either when thou waſt a ſervant, defrauded thy Maſter to get a ſtock to ſet up by, as is the cuſtome of divers; or being free and in Trade, thou haſt deceived and defrauded many men, and the treaſures of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe are yet in thy houſe. Thou comeſt to the Church, thou heareſt the Word, the Lord ſmites by the ſword of his mouth, and calls for this, that thou with ſpeed make reſtitution; thou wilt not doe it; why? thou ſtandſt upon thy credit; for if thou make open reſtitution, then thou ſhalt be accounted a fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and deceitfull man, and every body will caſt it in thy teeth upon any breach; if privately, thy credit will ſo ſinke, for thon art not able to drive a trade as before, and to maintaine thy ſelfe, wife, and children. Know this, thou art void of this ſervile feare, while thine heart is ſo full of pride, that it will not ſtoope to God and his commandement; for if thou fearedſt his power and juſtice, thou wouldeſt not ſtand upon this reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with men: Can he not make thy wickedneſſe knowne to thy ſhame? and can he not make thee as poore to thy diſhonour? If thou diddeſt feare this, thou wouldeſt never ſtand upon that. The like may be ſaid of men who make profeſſion of converſion and Religion, and yet neglect the duties of it, for feare of the ſcornes and reproaches of men, and ſtand upon reputation; they have no feare. But if thou canſt be content to hazard thy credit to obey him, that gives credit, and honour, and riches to whom he will, and takes them from he pleaſeth; it will prove to thy ſelfe and to others that thou haſt this feare at leaſe, what elſe may be more; if not, then the contrary; for there can be no place for feare, where the heart is paſſed up with pride. To obey God in honourable things, and things to be done without
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:151759:74"/>croſſe or hazard of credit, is but to ſerve themſelves.</p>
                        <p>The fifth effect of this feare is diligence and carefulneſſe, that is, it will never let a man reſt, till he have uſed all the meanes whereby he may have any hope to eſcape that which he is afraid of. Inſtance for the feare of man in <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 32.6. &amp;c. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 King. 21.27. Exod. 9.20. Acts 2.37. Acts 9.6. <hi>Ninevites.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Becauſe this feare is credulous, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> makes a man beleeve that will come which is threatened, and that ſuch things are not ſcarre-crowes, but if they be not prevented, they will come, and ſuſpects often more than is uttered. Now, that men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, they uſe meanes to compaſſe it, if good; to avoid it, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill: If good, hope for it; if evill, feare it, and ſo ſeeke to avoid it.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe feare breeds a deſire, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> whether a man feare he ſhall not enjoy ſome good he would have, or leſt ſome evill ſhould come upon him he would eſcape; the deſire to have, and the deſire to eſcape is increaſed by his feare. He that feares neither, may have ſome deſire; but when feare comes, it increaſeth his deſire: yea, as the feare increaſeth, ſo doth this. Now a deſire, and a deſire enlarged, gives a man no reſt, till he uſe the meanes to have, or eſcape; deſire is never without endeavour for it, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, to uſe all the meanes knowne unto the deſirer.</p>
                        <p>This, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> as the other two, argues great want of this feare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men are ſo ſecure, and uſe no meanes at all to avoid Gods judgments here, or to come; or uſe them careleſly and coldly, which muſt needs prove want of feare: when they heare that no adulterer, uſurer, blaſphemer, or any that loves and lyes in any ſmne, ſhall inherit Heaven, but ſhall have their portion in the burning Lake, without faith and repentance, which can never be had but by diligent and carefull hearing of the Word, this they contemne, or regard not; if it come not to them well, they will not feeke after it; if theſe fall into their mouths, well it is, but otherwiſe they will never trouble themſelves further about either of them: For if they be elected, they are ſure to be faved, and the refore they will leave all to Gods diſpoſition. Thus ſome ſay deſperately, but more deale thus, and ſhew plainely there is no feare of God in their hearts, or before their eyes; for that would keepe another manner of coyle in them, and would not ſuffer them to ſleepe ſo ſecurely in ſinne, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver regarding what became of themſelves. If they had this, we ſhould not need to threaten the wrath of God, nor to excite them to flye from the wrath to come, and by well-doing to ſeeke honour and immortality. And we ſhould need leſſe to doe it, or at leaſt we ſhould more prevaile with them; for them workes the hammer when the Iron and metall is mollified and ſoftened
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:151759:74"/>by the fire; then the Word, when men are ſoftened and molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by this feare: then the Word is moſt regarded, when the heart is wakened by the preſent feeling, or feare of judgment to come. Queſtionleſſe the generall ſecurity that hath overgrown the whole body of our people, that they neither ſeeke to eſcape the vengeance to come of themſelves, nor yet when the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God doe with one conſent threaten them: though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Johns</hi> have preached for a long time, that the Axe is laid to the root of the tree, yet they come not to enquire what to doe, as the people did, Luk. 3.9, 10. Our age as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is like to the old world, our Cities like <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah,</hi> ſtill ſecure. The plague of God that was upon our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and perſons, hath not wakened them, the Sword that was even at our heeles, hath not made them ſhake off ſecurity, and begin to feare: what is this but a fearing of ſome judgment that will make our hearts to ake, and the eares of poſterity to tingle when it ſhall be told them? according to that of Jer. 2.19. <hi>Thine owne wickedneſſe ſhall correct thee, and thy turnings back ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thee: know therefore and behold, that it is an evill thing and bitter, that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, and that my feare is not in thee, ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts.</hi> Yea finally, (to knit this to our preſent matter) what proves this elſe, but that the men of our times are ſo farre from the truth of Chriſtianity, howſoever they profeſſe themſelves to be Chriſtians, that they are not come ſo farre as yet to be Gods ſervants, worſe than ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, yea than beaſts, yea than Sathan, Jam. 2. <hi>who beleeves, and trembles.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This may teach every man to try whether he have this feare or no; <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> feare breeds carefulneſſe to avoid that is feared, or is and ought to be fearefull. Doth any man heare of the judgments of God ſounded out many wayes by the words and workes of God, is he careleſſe of them for himſelfe, for his family, if he have a charge; and poſſeſſed with the ſecurity of the age, not ſeeking all meanes to avoid them, not as the maſters of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, Exod. 9.20. <hi>ſuch then as feared the Word of the Lord among the ſervants of</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>made his ſervants and his cattle flee into the houſes.</hi> But as <hi>Gedaliah,</hi> when it was told him by many the danger by <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> he beleeved it not, and ſo would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, Jer. 40.14, 16. and ſaith, the Lord will doe no ſuch thing, and ſo will not take the meanes to avoid them: thou haſt not ſo much as this feare. And doſt thou thinke thy ſelfe a good Chriſtian, when thou goeſt not ſo farre as carnall, naturall, yea, Heathen men have done? But is any otherwiſe affected, when the Miniſters threaten, when God thunders, and ſhews ſome manifeſt proofe or figne of an approaching evill? Is it to thee like as <hi>Dalilaes</hi> voyce was to <hi>Sampſon?</hi> The Philiſtims are upon
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:151759:75"/>thee, making thee flee out of the lap of thy pleaſures, and all the delights of thy ſins, in making thee to ſeek all means poſſible to avoyd the evill to come, by hearing, believing, repenting and ſuch like, then haſt thou this feare; which though it be not a purging fear, yet is it a reſtrayning feare, not a ſaving feare; and grace itſelf, yet it makes way for that, which never comes before. Endeavour for it, and ſtrive to adjoyn the other, that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt begin a ſervant, proceed to a ſonne, and ſo at length a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in Gods houſe for ever, John 8.35.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Saith the Lord of Hoaſts unto you, O Prieſts</hi>] In Gods accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have ſeene the ground and the reaſon of it; we are now to proceed to the accuſation it ſelf, and here firſt, the Accuſer, God; Secondly the accuſed, Prieſts; Thirdly the Crime. It is not the Prophet who accuſeth them, who might happly bee ſuſpected to have done it, on ſome humor, and heat, and ſome finiſter reſpect; but the Lord himſelf, which the Prophet affirms to ſtrike more reverence in them to his meſſage, and to affect them to look to their wayes, and he is called the Lord of Hoaſts, who can eaſily puniſh all their wayes, having all at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
                        <p>For the ſecond, the perſons accuſed are the Prieſts, yet not excluding the people, as before the people were accuſed by name, and the Prieſts included; and the Prieſts are alone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, not that they ſinne alone, but being chiefe and greateſt ſinners, becauſe the people might extenuate their fault by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and by pleading example of Prieſts; but the Prieſts could have no excuſe, and the Prieſts duty was to reprove o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for prophaning Gods worſhip, and give examples; and therefore by negligence, and impiety teaching the people to bee prophane, they are juſtly here accuſed.</p>
                        <p>Miniſters as well as others, are lyable to be checked, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the word. <label type="milestone">

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:151759:75"/>treachery in friends, their profeſſion being fidelity. Micha. 7.5, 6, 7.

So if a ſonne omit the honour due to his father, or a ſervant the feare due to his maſter, is a greater ſinne; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to doe it to the ſame men, is not ſo hainous; ſo tis the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a wife to be a helper, that ſhe muſt indeavour in all things:

This people did the work of the Lord, brought their Sacrifices; but they did it careleſly and contemptuouſly, brought any thing, as thinking it good enough. This was one difference betwixt <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> though faith was the main, yet how carefull the one was, that thought the beſt was bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, the other, the worſt would ſerve, for he brought a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Gen. 4.3, 4. Hence are the qualities of the ſacrifices deſcribed in the Law; God requiring not only Sacrifices, but ſuch as were perfect without blemiſh, Levit. 22.20, 21, 23. Deuter. 17.1. But why this? but to ſhew how he requires the manner of doing, aſwell as the deed, and that he cannot endure
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:151759:77"/>corruption here. Hence <hi>Saul</hi> laboured to leſſen the fault, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſaved the chiefeſt for the Lord. 1 Sam. 15.15. Hence is that, Malach. 1.14. which we ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>

How many Miniſters preach the Word but for gain, for vain glory, for law, and for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, and not of conſcience; as law and cuſtomes bind them, when they have gifts and body able to doe it, oftner to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the Church; ſome in preaching make it ſerve their own turne, and ſerve themſelves out of it, and not God.

For prayer, how many Miniſters runne it over like jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-workes without affection and zeale, making the people to abhorre the ſacrifice of the Lord? How many of the people
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:151759:77"/>come late, carry themſelves without all reverence, ſitting ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, reading, and ſuch like, and there is no fault, all is well enough.

Now there is no repentance where there is perſeverance in it, when it is not left, and the former good done: for as he verily is wicked, that is not juſt; he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull, that is not thankfull; ſo doth he deſpiſe, that doth not honour God. The contrary evill is ever where the good is not, where, and when it ought to be; therefore muſt every one la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the good, that is, to honour God; not to doe the things and workes of his ſervice onely, but to doe them as his ſervice ſhould be done, being more carefull for the heart and affection, which God more reſpects than the action: thinking not as hypocrites, any thing is good enough, but that nothing is ſufficient: As <hi>Paul,</hi> who is ſufficient? ſo what is ſufficient? what care, diligence, endeavour of the heart and whole man? It is not the omitting of the worſhip of God, nor the neglect to leave ſome things undone, that is onely diſpleaſing unto the Lord; but when the Act is done, he may be as much offended: As here, the not offering of the ſacrifice was not the thing that diſpleaſed him, but when the ſacrifices were not ſo qualified as they ought, that he accounted contempt, becauſe it argued contempt: ſo in this, the quality of the ſervice is that which he accounts contempt, when they thought the deed was enough. The outward worke muſt be done as the ſacrifice ought by them to have beene offered; ſo God hath commanded, ſo muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample be given to others; but the intention, the heart is that which muſt make it acceptable unto God, as <hi>Gregory.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>YEE offer uncleane bread upon my Altar.</hi>] Here is Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to their defence. They who offer polluted things to God, deſpiſe his Name; but ſuch are you, for ye offer pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bread upon my Altar: where we muſt examine the ſenſe of three words: Firſt, Altar. Secondly, Bread. Thirdly, polluted or uncleane.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, by the Altar, there are ſome, and not of the meaneſt, who underſtand in this place the table of Shew-bread that ſtood in the Temple and Tabernacle, juſt over againſt the Candleſtick on the North-ſide, and the right hand of it. In the Tabernacle there were three diſtinct places; the Tabernacle, the holy place, and the moſt holy: The table of Shew-bread was in the ſecond, whither the Prieſts onely came. By the Altar then is underſtood the Altar of burnt offerings, which ſtood in the outward Court, whither both Prieſt and people came, and had like acceſſe when the Law was read, and their dayly ſacrifices were offered. And thus doth <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Cyrill</hi> underſtand it upon this place: ſo that we expound not this by that which is in the end of the Verſe, but that by this, becauſe we find in the Scripture the Table put often for the Altar, but not the Altar for the Table.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, by bread, ſome underſtand onely the Shew-bread, as <hi>Hierome;</hi> ſome, of bread which was offered with the burnt-offering on the Altar, Levit. 6.20. Numb. 28.6. Some, not of the bread onely, but of the fleſh alſo, or whatſoever thing elſe was offered there upon the Altar, which is the beſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; for the word here uſed ſignifies not bread alone, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo other victuall and meat, as it is uſed in the word, and as <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill</hi> expoundeth this place, and ſome other, for the bread of the ſacrifice; and eſpecially the Prophet himſelfe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. when he ſhews that he meant the ſacrifices and meat that was offered upon the Altar.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, by uncleane, what is meant; it is agreed of by moſt, that it is not any thing that is uncleane by nature, or naturally; that is, ſuch a thing as is abhominable to humane ſenſe, as Ezek. 4.12, 13. nor yet any thing that is uncleane morally: as all
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:151759:78"/>things are ſaid to be morally vile and polluted, that God doth diſallow and diſlike of; <hi>Nullum cadaver tam foedumaut faetidum</hi> (as <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith) to us, as the ſinners ſoule in the ſight of God. But it is myſtically unclean, that is, in regard of ſome myſticall ſignification, God having pronounced them typically unclean, to inſtruct ſome further matter, that thereby he would inure men the rather to abhorre them. And thus are all things ſaid to be unclean which are prohibited in the law ceremoniall; and ſo it is in this place. But theſe things were either unclean by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or of themſelves: in the firſt by touching a dead corps, or any uncleane thing; in the ſecond either in their kinde, as Iſaiah 66.17. or in quality only, that is, when it comes by ſome accident, of which, Deut. 17.1. of this is meant in this place, as the 8. verſe ſheweth.</p>
                        <p>And ſo here ſeemes to be a double fault taxed by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; one in the people, and the other in the Prieſts; and ſo a double duty exacted of them; the peoples fault was in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of polluted offerings, and preſenting them unto the Prieſts; their duty was to have brought ſuch as were ſound, entire and perfect; the Prieſts fault was in receiving them at their hands, and not reproving and prohibiting them; his duty was to have inſtructed them what ſacrifice they were to bring, and to reject that which was uncleane, and not according to the Law. Now theſe ſacrifices were to be cleane, and pure, and perfect, <hi>ad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum capitis,</hi> to ſhew the perfect purity of Chriſts humane nature, 2 Cor. 5.21. 1 Pet. 1.17. Secondly <hi>ad typum corporis,</hi> to ſhew what they ſhould be who are members of him, and that offer theſe ſacrifices unto God; that they ſhould be <hi>perfect to every good worke,</hi> 2 Tim. 5. and Rom. 12.1, 3. So that then, beſides that which hath been ſpoken for the ſacrifice, we may gather out of the peoples fault, (comparing outward things with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,) the type with the truth, that ſeeing God reaſons on this ſort; if they who bring polluted offerings unto me, contemne me, then ſuch as come polluted in themſelves, much more.</p>
                        <p>They who come to the publique ſervice of God, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                           </label> and come to offer him any ſacrifice muſt not be uncleane and polluted in their hearts and lives, but muſt come with holineſſe and purity; for if their ſacrifice, muſt be ſuch, then themſelves; and the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were commanded to be ſuch, becauſe they themſelves ought to be ſuch. When God reproved Iſrael for it, Iſaiah 1. and 66.3. and Jerm. 7.9, 10. he ſheweth what he required of them, and of others; to this purpoſe is, Pſal. 4.4, 5. Gen. 35.2. Joſhua. 24.16, 19, 23.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe God elſe will not accept their ſervice; for he firſt looks to their perſon, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> and then their ſervice, Gen. 4.4. for the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:151759:79"/>ſacrifice doth not ſanctifie the perſon, but the perſon it: as <hi>Haggai.</hi> 2.13, 14. Proverb. 15.8.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe elſe that which God offers and gives to them, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> is made hurtfull unto them; not that God gives any evill, but becauſe they are evill that receive it. As the Sacrament to <hi>Judas,</hi> Chriſt gave not that which was evill; nor did he, being the Phyſitian, give the poyſon; but <hi>Judas</hi> being wicked, it became evill unto him: for as the ſpyder and the adder turn good meat into poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and as a corrupt ſtomacke, abounding with choler and ſuch like, turneth the meat they eate into choler, and the finer the meat is, it is the ſooner turned to corruption; ſo is it in this thing, Titus 1.15. <hi>

They are more guilty of contempt againſt the Lord, then if they withdrew themſelves altogether from his obedience and houſe. A man having committed ſome offence againſt his Prince, &amp; being ſummoned to appeare perſonally in his preſence, if he refuſe to come at him, and ſhun his ſight, may well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of contumacy, but not of contempt, for he may do it out of fear; and contempt and fear cannot ſtand together in one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; but if he ſhall confidently come &amp; appeare before him, as if he had done no ſuch thing, or not offended him, ſhew no ſorrow for his offence, make no promiſe of amendement, nay ſhall rather ſtand in it, &amp; with an impudent face avow it, &amp; profeſſe to perſiſt in it, this muſt needs be judged a groſſe &amp; outragious contempt. Now the place of Gods worſhip is his preſence, and he that commeth thither, commeth to look God full in the face; as <hi>Cain</hi> was caſt out from the <hi>face</hi> of the Lord. Gen. 4.16. If he come nor, he ſhall ſuffer as <hi>contnmax,</hi> as rebellious and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient; but he that commeth polluted, with the filth of his ſin unrepented of, with a purpoſe to perſiſt, he ſhall be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed as a contemner. They who refuſed to come were ſhut out, but he that came in his old cloathes, was bound hand and foot, &amp; caſt into utter darknes, Math. 22. he that is willfully abſent, excluding himſelfe from the ſociety of the Saints, in the time of grace, ſhalbe barred their company in the time of glory for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; but he that preſumeth to appeare there, with the guilt of his ſinne on him, ſhall have a farre greater portion in Hell fire, he ſhall ſuffer as in caſe of contempt, like an inſolent rebell, that bourdeth his Prince to his face in his owne Palace; and in the mean time all their prayers are unaccepted, yea they are turned

                        <p>
                           <hi>And if you offer the blinde for ſacrifice, it is not evill:]</hi> Theſe words are read of ſome by way of interrogation, <hi>When yee offer the blinde, is it not evill?</hi> Now a negative interrogation ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth ſtrongly: q. d. it is very evill, and yet yee doe it. <hi>Hierom, Junius:</hi> others read theſe words by way of affirmation, God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to tax their thoughts; you think it not evill, you think it is good enough for God, you make it no fault; and this is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reading, which is more agreable to the context: but the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not great how we take it, both tend to one end and one effect, both a diſliking &amp; diſallowing of ſuch ſacrifice.</p>
                        <p>For the ſacrifice here ſpoken of, ſome underſtand it only of the ſacrifice the Prieſts offered for themſelves. Levit. 4.3. Heb. 5.3. Others for the ſacrifice the people brought; which when they were burnt offerings, which were all conſumed upon the Altar, the Prieſts nothing regarded; but the ſinne-offering to be eaten by the Prieſts, for thoſe they were marvellous carefull they might be of the beſt; and ſome expound them of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples offerings in generall, whether they were burnt offerings, ſinne offerings, or peace offerings, or whatſoever; and thoſe words <hi>(it is not evill)</hi> ſome take for the Peoples words, it is good enough for the Prieſts; or it is good enough to be burnt to aſhes; others make the Prieſt heartening the people in that practiſe, which is very probable, God before directing his ſpeech to the Prieſts.

                        <p>The Prophet had told them of their baſe thought of Gods Table: to this they might happily reply or object; you take too much upon you, to ſee into our hearts, and to cenſure our thoughts. to this the Prophet makes by inſinuation in an anſwer, though cloſely, that he need not to dive ſo deepe, their life and practice taught as much; a man might eaſily read the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe of their hearts in the uncleaneneſſe of their gifts, and their contempt of God in their carriage. The thoughts of men are knowne either immediately and directly by God alone, Jer. 17.10. Matth. 9.4. or mediately and indirectly, and ſo man may know them; either as God revealeth them, Ezek. 14.1, 2, 3. or as men diſcover them by their actions, looks, or ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; Firſt, Matth. 7.16. <hi>Ye ſhall know them by their fruts: doe men gather grapes of thornes? or figs of thiſtles?</hi> Secondly, Iſaiah 3.9. <hi>The ſhew of their countenance doth witneſſe againſt them.</hi> Thirdly, Luke 6.45. In this place the firſt is underſtood.</p>
                        <p>Now this people are not reproved for bringing no ſacrifice, but faulty ſacrifice, faulty for quality, contrary to the Law. Levit. 22.21, 22. Now what is ſpoken of their ſacrifice, may be ſpiritually applyed to ours, that we may make ſome benefit out of this. The Sacrifice of the Church in the New Teſtament are:
<list>
                              <item>Firſt, men themſelves, and that firſt in life, ſoules and bodies conſecrated unto Gods ſervice, both in their generall callings &amp; their particular places. Rom. 12.1. <hi>Preſent your bodies a living ſacrifice,</hi> not to ſlaughter them, but the corruption of them. Rom. 6.6, 13. Now the mortifying of the affection killeth not the man, Pſal. 51.17. As the Ram, not <hi>Iſaac</hi> was ſlaine, though hee was offered. Read Gen. 22. Mar. 12.33. 1 Sam. 15.22. Secondly, in death, in offering their ſoules to Gods hand, Luk. 23.46. Acts 7.59. and their bodies for teſtimony of the truth, being called to it. Phil. 2.17. 2 Tim. 4.6.</item>
                              <item>Secondly, the Sacrifices of the New Teſtament are, ſome thing from themſelves immediately to God, as praiſes and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, compared to <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> Pſal. 50.14, 15. <hi>Drinke offering,</hi> Pſal. 116.31. <hi>Incenſe.</hi> Pſal. 141.2. Hoſea 14.3. Apocal. 5.8. and 8.3, 4. Secondly, to man for God, as Almes. Heb. 13.16. Pſal. 4.18. Matth. 12.7.</item>

By lame, he may meane when things are done without minde and heart, with the outward man, not inward; for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, feare, praiſe, &amp;c.

                           <hi>Offer now unto thy Prince, Captaine, or Ruler.]</hi> there was then no King in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for the kingly dignity was extinct in <hi>Jechoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> Jer. 22. but they onely had Captaines over them, appointed by the Perſian King, to whom they were in bondage: As <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel</hi> is called the Captaine of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Haggai 1.1. and ſo it is made more offenſive, that they uſed God as they would not doe a meane man, not a King, but a Captaine: and it is as if God had ſaid, Now make tryall of the good will of your Captaine towards you, which is more familiar to you, being a man, and inferiour to a King; whom if thou laboureſt thus to reconcile unto thy ſelfe, thou ſhalt more offend, and excite againſt thee. What an indignity is this then againſt me, that I ſhould be no more, or not ſo much accounted of, as a meane Captaine? how ſhould not this, in ſtead of reconciling me, more diſpleaſe and provoke me? And what can you looke for from me, ſo mighty a God, to defend and vindicate my glory and ſervice from ſuch indignities, but wrath and diſpleaſure? <hi>Will he be content with thee, or will it pleaſe him?</hi> as if hee ſaid, undoubtedly it will marvellouſly diſpleaſe him.</p>

                        <p>In the whole he anſwereth, that they might object, that he tooke too much upon him to pry into their thoughts &amp; hearts; when he did no otherwiſe than ordinarily he might doe, judge their lives by their practices. The point then is:</p>
                        <p>The wickedneſſe of the life proclaimeth and preacheth to men the prophaneneſſe of the heart, as Pſal. 14.1. <label type="milestone">

So there is another way for man to know, Titus. 1.16. <hi>They profeſſe that they know God, but by works they deny him, and are abominable and diſobedient, and unto every good worke reprobate.</hi> And this is enough to condemne them of impiety and prophaneneſſe, of contempt of God, want of the feare of God, before man that ſeeth the outward man onely, and muſt by it judge of the inward.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:151759:88"/>is by them noted as a Phariſee, that is, an hypocrite: That, as he ſaid, <hi>Non poteſt eſſe ſalvus, qui non vult eſſe malus; ſalvus ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem à linguis maledicis;</hi> ſi it is, 1 Pet. 4.4. <hi>It ſeemeth unto them ſtrange, that ye runne not with them unto the ſame exceſſe of riot; therefore ſpeake they evill of you.</hi> But as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaid, that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam,</hi> when he thought to have curſed Gods people for hyre, did bleſſe them againe and againe, though againſt his will: ſo theſe men more commend, than diſcommend theſe perſons, where they ſeeke ſo to diſgrace them, while unwillingly they heape praiſes as reproaches upon them, and while they goe about to back-bite them, againſt their wills they acquit them, becauſe the object good things inſtead of evill againſt them, as if they could find no matter of evill in them.</p>

If they cannot juſtly challenge them for omitting the greater they cannot make them hypocrites: nay, happily theſe that are cenſured, may juſtly by Chriſts rule judge their cenſurers as hypocrites, becauſe they omit the leſſe, and are altogether negligent in them. For undoubtedly the heart can be ſound in neither, that is not in both. Luke 16.10. <hi>He that is faithfull in the leaſt, he is alſo faiothfull in much; and he that is unjuſt in the leaſt, is unjuſt alſo in much.</hi> It is a ſure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of an hypocrite, for a man to live apparently in the practice of any one known ſinne, though in other things hee ſeeme ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſtrict. For Eccleſ. 10.12. <hi>Any one dead Fly corrupts the oyntment.</hi> But to condemne a man for an hypocrite, in being ſtricter than our ſelves in ſome caſes, and for being nice in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſmall moment; when the whole tenour of his life is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe righteous alſo, it is to condemne him for that which Chriſt will commend him for at the laſt, when no man ſhall take his praiſe or his joy from him, Matth. 25.21. But theſe men thus condemne themſelves; for as the Heathen <hi>

In a word, thus to judge is a moſt corrupt courſe; as if a man would needs have it, that the tree is rotten at the roote,

But we anſwer them, that their lives tell us what lyes hid: nay that which is within cannot be hid, becauſe their lives are ſuch: For Math. 7.18. a man need not dig into the ground to ſee what the root is, the fruit will eaſily diſcover the tree; ſo is it with the heart &amp; actions; by good actions we may be deceived, becauſe of the diſpoſition of the partie, Math. 6. <hi>Almes and Prayers by vaine glory,</hi> or want of ſincerity, are not good at all to the doer: but evill can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be good by good intention; for that which is evill in it ſelf, cannot be made good to any for any end. And ſo evill actions ſtill argue an evill heart, as bad fruits an evill tree: And ſo it is a very ridiculous thing for men to brag of a ſound and good heart, when their lives be as they bee. For Jam. 3.11. <hi>Evill words,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>corrupt good manners,</hi> their own and others, much more evill workes good men; yea, they argue the doer corrupt within; for it is not the fruit makes the tree bad, but it is the badneſſe of the tree that maketh the bad fruit; the fruit diſcovereth the naughtineſſe of the tree: For as the Adder hath a ſting before he ſtingeth, ſo are men wicked before they work wickedneſſe; then is it knowne ſhe hath a ſting, and they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: for as the mouth ſpeaketh from the abundance of the heart, ſo the heart worketh from the abundance of the ſoule; ſo that lawfull it is for me to judge a common ſwearer, a known adulterer, a manifeſt deceiver, an uſuall drunkard, &amp;c. to have a corrupt heart: for when the earth is broken up, and a filthy ſtench commeth out, argues it not that there was ſome dead corps there? ſo when men ſend out curſings, blaſphemies, ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, raylings, and ſuch like, that a man ſhould not be able to endure, from whence iſſue theſe, but from a dead and a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſoule? theſe carry about them then the grave and ſepulcher of the Soule. Now that which is ſaid of the words, may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the workes. As a man therefore comming to a tombe, though never ſo coſtly and curiouſly, or ſo royally deckt, yet if at ſome vent be apprehend a filthy ſavour iſſuing out of it, he knoweth well there is not only a dead, but a rotten carkaſſe within; ſo when a man feeleth a filthy and unwholſome ſent, either of prophane ſpeech, or of diſſolute life iſſuing from the heart, which is the fountaine of both, he muſt needs conclude, neither is it againſt charitie to cenſure it, that there is a ſoule
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:151759:90"/>not only dead and buried, but even rotten in ſinne and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore let no man delude himſelfe, while he would deceive others, to beare men in hand that he is ſound at heart, when he is unſound and corrupt in his life; as if a man might beperſwaded that it is a vine or figtree which he ſeeth hanging full of crabs and wildings. Nay it muſt needs be otherwiſe; therefore as Chriſt ſaid, Math. 12.33. <hi>Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; Or elſe make the tree evill, and his fruit evill: for the tree is known by his fruit.</hi> If thou hate ſinne, ſhew it in thy life; if thou feare God, ſhew it by thy carefull walking in his waies, and ſeeking to pleaſe him; If thou loveſt the word, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the aſſembly with diligence and devotion, and not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſely and ſlippily: If thou thinke reverently of the ſervice of God, be carefull reverently to addreſſe thy ſelfe to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it: Otherwiſe know, thy practice proclaimes the want of theſe things; and thinke not much if others judge thee by that, for thy have their warrant from Chriſt their King; <hi>By their fruits you ſhall know them.</hi>

The work is common to hypocrites and profane men, with the Children of God; the affection is proper to his owne; not that the other have not the naturall affection, but that they have not the ſanctified affection: Their affections are about worldly

If a great man be offended with them, as <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> they will intreat friends and neighbours and others, tend patiently many dayes, entreat humbly once and again, a 100. times, and if he will not bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, they can not be in quiet: but when they have offended God, they can lye and ſleep ſecurely, and take their eaſe, and follow their pleaſures, ſhews not this their corruption? From the ſame corruption is it, that if they receive any benefit from men, or by them, they labor to be thankfull, and to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; but though they cannot but looke upon ſome of Gods bleſſings, they return none to him. As men are liberall in thansk for their feaſts and refreſhings, to the inſtruments, not to the author: as <hi>Baſil.</hi> As little children that thinke they have their coats from the taylor that maketh them, and bringeth them home and putteth them on, by reaſon of their weake conceit: from this corruption is it, that men miſlike diſobedient ſonnes and bad ſervants of other men; becauſe it may be their owne caſe to be abuſed ſo by their own, and the bad example of others may be a meanes to effect the like in theirs; when they no waies be like affected when they are rebellious to the word of God. Maſters will be bitter to ſervants for unthankfulneſſe, negligence and careleſneſſe of their commodities, whereas they never take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their lying and ſwearing, (that brings in gaine) of propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Gods day; becauſe the one concerneth them, and may be a meanes of their danger and loſſe, and the other nothing ſo neere toucheth them, which maketh God give them over to their corruption, to be more unfaithfull to them. To be briefe, all hate a covetous man more then a prodigall man, and an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſour, more then a filthy liver, As S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, becauſe the one is ſuch as he is more like to injure us then the other; though the other diſhonour God as much, and doe as much hurt.

                        <p>Thus ought we to labor againſt this corruption, and to ſtrive to feare God, <label type="milestone">

To give ſome particulars; they are to carry a Preſent to keepe or recover the favour of ſome man: will they carry of the worſt things they have, ſuch as they cannot well beſtow otherwiſe? they will not, leſt they ſhould gaine diſpleaſure rather than fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and yet for God and the uſes he hath commanded, they will offer that which they have no uſe for otherwiſe. Are they not then guilty of this? Will any man ſerve all his youth againſt his Prince as a Rebell, and after in old age, when he is unfit for ſervice, come and proffer him his endeavour and fidelity? he will not, leſt he ſhould be puniſhed by him, rather than accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Or ſay he called for his ſervice when he was in health and ſtrength, and he refuſed to worke with him, will he offer it when he is weake and ſick? he will not, leſt he ſhould be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and puniſhed: and yet his youth will he ſpend againſt God in the ſervice of ſin and Satan, yea, his ſtrength and health, though God called for it and challenged it; and offer himſelfe, when he is in age, weakneſſe, and ſickneſſe, to doe him ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: And is he not guilty of this ſinne? Will a man, when he is in a good eſtate, in a flouriſhing and proſperous condition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the friendſhip and familiarity of another man, and thinke when he is in miſery to have it and enjoy it to his good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort? he will not, leſt he be then ſcorned and rejected. As Judges 11.7. <hi>Jephtha</hi> then anſwered the Elders of <hi>Gilead, Did ye not hate me, and expell me out of my fathers houſe?

As he made the love of a mans ſelfe the rule of his love to others, becauſe it is more naturall unto him by much; ſo in this, when any man is then about duties to God, if not otherwiſe he have a heart to doe them, in all ſimplicity, yet, as <hi>Chryſoſt.

So as wee would doe duties to men, doe them to God, if not otherwiſe; and thinke whether the Prince, or a man of any worth, would accept ſuch things from us. If God ſend his meſſengers and Miniſters to us, bringing glad tidings of peace, thinke wee if the Prince ſhould ſend an Ambaſſadour unto us with good comforts and great promiſes, how would we heare him, and ſtrive to it; how uſe him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and reſpect, by no meanes deny him any obedience, much leſſe abuſe him in word or deed? So for the Miniſters, if they were ſent from men to men, what faithfulneſſe, care, and diligence would they uſe? Thinke when thou art to pray to God, how thou wouldeſt put up a petition to the Prince, with what ſubmiſſion, reverence, attention, and humility. If thou art to come to his Table, and called to it, thinke how if the Prince called thee to his, thou wouldeſt remove impediments, ſet aſide excuſes, come with all preparation as a gueſt fitting his Table. God requires ſervice of thee as his ſervant, thinke if thou wert the Kings ſervant in ordinary, what wouldeſt thou doe for the time thy ſervice is required: doe that, and wholly that, and little of thy owne, the moſt of the day ſpent in his: So thinke if thou beeſt Gods ſervant, what is required of all the dayes of thy life; the chiefeſt and greateſt part of it. God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires almes and reliefe of thee, a portion for his ſervants and houſhold, his Levites and Miniſters, and the poore. Doe not uſe them as men doe the Kings takers, hide the beſt things from them, and thinke every thing too good; thou knoweſt he will not then accept thy perſon, but be angry with thee. So in this; Thou wilt ſay many Miniſters are wicked and unworthy, ſo thou maiſt ſay of many takers and purveyours; yet if thou deny to them the Kings due, though they ſhall be puniſhed, yet ſhalt thou be checked. So in this, looke to God, and not them.</p>

                           <hi>This hath been by your means,]</hi> Now the Prophet laieth upon the Prieſts the cauſe of this curſe that is befallen the people: ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre this to the former part, ſhewing that they ſhould pray, becauſe they had been in fault. It is true that they ought chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to ſeeke to turne to God, that are authors of his wrath; But
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:151759:98"/>then ſhould this be taken by way of exhortation, not upbray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. But this is referred of ſome to the latter, ſhewing the reaſon why God will not heare nor accept, becauſe they are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this evill, and therefore unfit to pray to God for the reſt. This hath been by your meanes, by your fault hath this evill happened untous; for it is not ſo much the fault of the people, who bring ſuch imperfect ſacrifice to the Temple, as yours who receive them for gaine, and neither reprove the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of the people, nor inſtruct their ignorance, as by your office you ought.</p>

                        <p>He will give to none of you, nor accept your prayers.

As in that of <hi>Michaiah,</hi> 1 Kings 22.15. for verſe 16. <hi>Ahab</hi> diſcerned well his meaning, that he did but ſcoffe at him and his falſe Prophets; ſo that he ſpeakes as he thinkes, not for the very words, but for the matter of the words. Neither makes the place in the Epheſians againſt this, becauſe it forbids ſcurrility, when men ſcoffe and reproach others raſhly, when there can be no edifying of others, or good to the party, but their malice and diſdaine ſhewed, and as well the modeſt and temperate hearers, as the ſufferers are offended; which is that which differeth farre from theſe things; we can not bring theſe within compaſſe of a lye unleſſe we make the Spirit of truth a lying Spirit: And in theſe a man hath no intent to have his words otherwiſe taken then he meaneth them.</p>

And if it be impoſſible, the prayers muſt needs be vaine. Beſides, if it were not, yet in that which Papiſts give their reaſon for, it is made more abhominable; that is, to make way for themſelves to the favour of God, even as by Nobles and great men we procure acceſſe to the King. <hi>Numquid tam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens est aliquis, &amp;c.</hi> Is there any ſo mad, ſaith <hi>Ambroſe in Epiſt. ad Rom. cap.</hi> 1. or ſo careleſſe of his life, that he will give the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the King to a Noble man, to procure him acceſſe to him, when he ſhall be guilty of treaſon, when hee commeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.

It goes hard with the Church when her good Prophets are by God forbidden to pray for it, as Jer. 14.11. But yet if they remaine with them, though they cannot prevaile at one time, yet they may at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but more hard when he takes them away, when they are without hope of having them to ſtand up for them againe; but worſt of all when they are ſuch as are of lewd life, who thereby provoke God againſt them. Therefore theſe both ſhoudl bee mourned for, the loſſe of the one, and the ſucceſſion of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for the former are, as the King ſaid, the Charets and the horſemen of Iſrael, the latter are the Charets and horſemen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Iſrael; for not being with it, they are againſt it: of good Miniſters we may ſay, as Pſal. 127.4, 5. as are the arrowes in the hand of the ſtrong man, ſo are they who are her good Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: bleſſed is the Church that hath a quiverfull of them, here is her proſperity and peace; hence is the ruine and overthrow of her Enemies.

If he be a faithfull one, he ſhall bee heard together with the Church; if otherwiſe, not he, but the faithfull people, who ſpeake to God by his words. But you will ſay then, what loſſe have we if the Miniſter be wicked? I anſwer, many wayes, becauſe the corruption of men is ſuch, that as they like the Word and Sacrament worſe, becauſe they diſlike him that brings them, and finde not ſuch joy and comfort in them, as by his hands they like; ſo they cannot bee, nor are not ſo affected to joyne in prayer with a man they like not, or thinke not well and reverently of, to whoſe perſons they have juſt exceptions, ſo their prayers are not as they ſhould be, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he with that ſpirit and affection utters their petitions to God; which might affect their hearts to more zeale in prayer.

                           <hi>Among the Gentiles]</hi> The perſons, by condition Gentiles, or Nations, taken ſometime generally for a company of People conſiſting of many families gathered together, Iſaiah, 1.4. Ioh. 11.52. Secondly more particularly for all people beſides the Iewes, all Infidels, Gods people being taken from among them only, Iſaiah, 49.6. And ſo it is amongſt thoſe who were not Gods people before, amongſt them whom the Iewes accounted fooles, and did extreamely hate; ſpoken as it were to provoke them to make more care of the worſhip of God, according to the denouncing, Deuter. 32.21.</p>

                        <p>Secondly, It is ſaid to be an oblation or offering, by which is not underſtood the Leviticall offering abrogated by Chriſt, neither the ſacrifice of Chriſt upon the croſſe, which none can offer but he; and which only was to be performed and offered upon the croſſe before the gate of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> nor the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, as ſhall after appeare, but by this is underſtood a mans ſelfe, every faithfull man with all that he hath; for every one of Gods ought both to conſecrate himſelfe to the ſpirituall worſhip of God, and as it were ſacrifice himſelfe, and alſo offer up the ſacrifice of prayer and praiſe, and of repenting, juſtice, almes and other things pleaſing to God. Rom. 13.1. 1 Pet. 2.5. Heb. 13.15, 16. Pſal. 4.6. and 5.19. And of this <hi>Irenaeus, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> and diverſe other underſtand this place.</p>

                           <hi>Pure]</hi> not ſimply without ſpot, Iſaiah, 64.6. but as the Church is called holy and without ſpot, Cant. 6.9. firſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the perſon offering it is in Chriſt, and as his perſon hath his obedience and righteouſneſſe applyed and imputed to it, ſo his obedience hath Chriſt to cover the wants of it. Heb. 13.15. 1 Pet. 2.5.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, In regard of inward ſanctification, the ground of it, the party being regenarate by the worke of his ſpirit, and ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

                        <p>This, though a threatning, yet is according to that, Deuter. 32.21. and ſo a kind of provocation to the Iſraelites, provoking them from the example of the Gentiles with a holy emulation in piety and the worſhip of God. The Iewes embraced not ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the worſhip of God, but putting it as it were from them, the Gentiles received it.</p>
                        <p>When one Church maketh not account of the truth and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, or doth reject it, another ſhall embrace it. <label type="milestone">

But the oppoſition is betwixt the Leviticall ſacrifices which were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in one only place, &amp; for which God was offended that they were ſo corruptly offered, and the cleane ſacrifices among the Gentiles.</p>

                        <p>But that this cannot be underſtood of the Maſſe, and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in it, is thus proved: we would demand of them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they take theſe words properly, or figuratively; If proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then this place muſt needs be underſtood of legall worſhip, and ſo doth not pertaine to the new Teſtament; yea then muſt they offer incenſe in the Maſſe as well as bread. If figuratively, then is the Maſſe a Metaphoricall and figurative ſacrifice, and not a true, reall, and outward ſacrifice, as they ſay it is. But if they will take the firſt metaphorically, and the latter properly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the monſtrous abſurdity of it, ſee what follows; the word ſignifies a ſacrifice made of flowre, oyle and incenſe, a breaden ſacrifice, Levit. 2.1. then overthrow they their tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for if they offer bread, it is not his body: finally, that this cannot be underſtood of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from circumſtance of place and perſon; for this may be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered every where, that not, but upon an Altar only; This by all the Gentiles, that by Prieſts only.</p>
                        <p>By this then we underſtand onely ſpirituall ſacrifices of the new Teſtament, as it is uſuall with the Prophets to ſet them out by the names of the ſacrifices of the old Teſtament, that they might more familiarly ſhew to them of this age, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are called to the true religion.</p>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:151759:122"/>out unto us why the Miniſters are in ſuch contempt, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it ſelfe is in contempt.

Rom. 3.8. Thou art lying upon thy ſick-bed, it may be thy death-bed, which is the time when men diſtribute things of moment and perpetuity.

                        <p>To ſay nothing of theſe, for which many have either the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, or have them hanging over their heads; But volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary vowes, men in ſome trouble or ſickneſſe renew their vow of obedience, as <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Hoſea 6.1, 2. but when that is once paſt, either they doe not care for keeping it, or thinke they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged well enough, if they doe a few dayes heare the Word, or performe ſome one or two good duties, and after give over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, unlike <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.106, 112. The Prophet tells them they are accurſed, better it had beene for them never to have vowed it at all; for though without it it is a ſinne, yet now it is the greater ſin.</p>
                        <p>To teach every man to take heed how he vows anything un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> for often in the vow he may deſerve Gods curſe, and often in the breaking it. In the vow, when it is of unlawfull things, Acts 23.12. then it is the bond of iniquity. Secondly, when the party vowing is not able to performe it, either ſimply, or not without ſinne, as Popiſh ſingle life. Matth. 19.11. Thirdly, when a party vowing is an inferiour, and doth it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:151759:132"/>the conſent, or contrary to the mind of the ſuperior; Numb. 30.6, 9. So Papiſh children, contrary to Parents minds, enter their rules. Fourthly, when it hindreth a man from the duties of his calling; as thoſe who leave their calling and goods to profeſſe wilfull poverty, or become Friars <hi>Mendicant.</hi> 1 Cor. 7.22. Fiftly, when there is put holineſſe in it, and it is made meritorious: If it be faulty in theſe or any the like, then is ſin committed in the making of it, and ſo a curſe followeth it; but if not, then the curſe followeth the breaking of it. When then it is ſo hard a thing to vow, and not to have ſinne cleave to it, if there be any feare of ſinne, there will be raſhneſſe avoided in it; and if there be any feare of the curſe, they will not be ſo raſh, leſt they provoke God. Eccleſ. 5.1.</p>
                        <p>To teach every man, when he hath vowed, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> to be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the performance of it, and let neither coſt nor labour, profit nor pleaſure hinder him, for he ſhall loſe more by the breaking of it, than he can gaine. The ſinne of breaking a mans vow or promiſe, ought to make men affraid to doe it. Men feare perjury, and abhorre it; this is no leſſe, if Chriſt may be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Matth. 5.33. But if not the ſinne, yet the curſe, and to avoid it, make good that thou haſt ſpoken to God. I ſuppoſe many men in the time and heate of the ſickneſſe vowed great things to God, if they were preſerved, and if God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne in mercy to the City, that they might in ſafety follow their callings againe; for I cannot thinke but that moſt men, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when God came any thing nigh them, were affected and touched for the preſent, which uſually brings forth ſuch thoughts and ſuch motions. If any were not, I think their caſe is marvellous fearefull, to be in the fire, and no relenting. Then you that did, remember your vowes, and ſee where is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them; it may be ſought for, but not early ſeene, or ſeen in a very few: And what is to be expected but theſe curſes, and more heavy than we have had? If your children or ſervants, all the time you are correcting of them, and holding the rod o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, promiſe to learne their books better, and doe their worke more diligently, whereupon you ſpare them; if they after deale deceitfully with you, will not your diſpleaſure be doubled, and your anger be increaſed, and you thinke law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully too? thinke Gods waies are more equall and juſt. If thou wouldeſt avoid this, then doe as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, and did; Pſal. 66.13, 14. <hi>I will goe into thine houſe with burnt offerings, and I will pay my vowes which my lips have promiſed, and my mouth hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in my affliction.</hi> If a man vow when he is in cuſtody or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, that when he getteth liberty, he will goe and dwell in a place where the Word is; if the Word goe from thence, he is not bound, Ruth 1.16, 17. Againe, in caſes of neceſſity, as a
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:151759:133"/>man bound to abſtaine from Wine, yet if Phyſitians counſell it for his health, he may uſe it; as Jer. 35.11. yet ſo, as hee have a ſpeciall eye to the maine end for which his vow was made: as ſuppoſe <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.23. to abſtaine, yet for his often infirmities he may drinke.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:151759:134"/>the body, they cannot for the ſoule; nay that, which for the body is complained of, as diſhoneſt and unfaithfull when it is not done, they cry out of it, if it be done to the ſoule. In the body, for the health of it, men can endure not only preſcription, but application of Phyſicke; yea, of ſharpe, bitter, and biting things. If they ſend for a Phyſitian who feeles their pulſe, diſcerneth their urine, and conceiveth of their diſeaſe, and yet fall onely to diſcourſe of the excellentneſſe of Phyſicke, and other diſeaſes, and never come any thing to theirs at all, they would happily judge him a great Scholar, but no wiſe man, nor fit for a Phyſitian; and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily call in queſtion his fidelity. But for the ſoule, if the ſpirituall Phyſitian apply any thing, if it have any ſharpneſſe in it, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, and living among them, and ſeeing their eſtate, he touch them, and apply it to them, he is accounted no wiſe man, hapily a buſie and indiſcreet fellow. The Phyſitian takes not the way to ſave their bodies, and he is cried out on: the Miniſter takes the way to ſave their ſoules, and he is cried out of. The Phyſitian that will preſcribe, and ſee his patient take it, and come to ſee how it workes with him, is much commended for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, care and fidelity: But if the Miniſter do the like, he is buſie and medling; but he that will pleaſe men, is not the ſervant of Chriſt: and theſe muſt know, when he deales with their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſinnes, out of a generall text, he hath his warrant enough, ſuch as ſhall acquit him.</p>

They muſt therefore apply it to themſelves. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters application may diſcharge himſelfe, but not profit them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they will apply and keep it. The Patient, if he take not, and endevour to keep the potion preſcribed and brought, by ſmelling of vinegar, or the like, labouring againſt the bad humours of the ſtomacke, ſhall have little profit by the Phyſick, but rather hurt: So it is in this, they muſt heare all, and labour to retain all; but learne that eſpecially which concernes themſelves, places and conditions. One man ſhould not ſo greedily receive that which toucheth another man, and let paſſe that which is to him; or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that to others which is to himſelfe, but every man that which is for himſelfe. He never proves a good Scholar, which is buſie to learne other of his fellowes leſſons, and neglecteth his owne: nor he a good Chriſtian that can take out other mens duties, and not his owne, not know what is for him.</p>

                           <hi>This commandment is for you.]</hi> The reaſon why they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, becauſe the charge hereof was by God laid on them: God had commanded them to look to this; he is thought by this, to cut off every excuſe which might be made againſt his reproof, either why they have not done it, or why hereafter they ſhould not do it. As for the people, they might ſay, they were bare with their long journey and coſt of building, and they were growne old, and if they were not tolerated thus to do, they would bring nothing at all, and his worſhip would fall to the ground. The Prophet anſwereth, That God hath commanded, and therefore they are to doe it, whatſoever come of it.</p>
                        <p>Whatſoever God commandeth men, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                           </label> or calleth them to, that they muſt obey and do; whatſoever inconvenience may follow of it, they muſt ſhut their eyes againſt them all, and put their hand into Gods hand, to be led by him whitherſoever he will. So with theſe: <hi>Abraham</hi> obeyed God to go out of his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey when God called him, not objecting the inconveniences, Gen. 12.4. And when to offer up <hi>Iſaac,</hi> not objecting, as he might if he had conſulted with fleſh and blood, infinite things againſt it. Gen. 22. Hereto is that, Exod. 34.23.24. Levit. 25.20. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat. 1.16.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe all inconveniences in the world, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> will not excuſe the fact, mans diſobedience; it may ſometime leſſen it in mans reaſon, but not defend it in Gods judgement.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe God is able either to take away thoſe inconveniences, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> or to make them turne to his owne glory, and the advantage of man, who in a ſincere conſcience doth obey him. And he will do ſo as in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the three Children.</p>
                        <p>To reprove all thoſe who refuſe to obey thoſe things they are taught and ſhewed, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> that God hath commanded, becauſe of ſome inconveniences they foreſee will follow: They ſhall happily be debarred of their pleaſure, or deprived of their profit, or be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced of great ones, or derided of inferiours: therefore they will not be religious, nor profeſſors, nor reforme their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, nor be carefull of their lives, and ſeek to make conſcience of their wayes, as if God cannot bring theſe upon them for evill, as well and more then man for good: Or as if theſe had not befallen men in their diſobedience, as well as thoſe who have obeyed him. As if theſe can excuſe a man when he ſhal come before the Judge,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151759:135"/>or he ſhall not be ſtript naked of them all, and be left alone to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for his diſobedience. Men are taught they ought to deale plainly and truly with others in weight and meaſure, to ſpeake truth, and not to lie, and ſuch like: They ſee then they ſhall not grow rich as others, and be eſteemed of as others, as they think; and therefore they chuſe rather by ſuch meanes to grow rich, then to obey God: as if their comming into the world was onely to get riches, and not to honour and obey God. Teach them to be liberall unto the poore for good cauſes, and to make them friends with the riches of iniquity, Luk. 10.9. and that God will give them uſe for it: They will anſwer or thinke as the widow of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repta did, 1 Kings 17. they have little enough for themſelves and theirs, and they feare to want before they die, or not to leave enough for theirs. As if that they left behinde them were theirs, and not rather that they ſent before. As Princes have more uſe of that they ſend by their Harbingers, then of that they leave in their ſtanding houſes: ſo ſhould they have more profit by that they give before, then that they leave behinde. Perſwade them to make reſtitution of that they have wrongfully taken from men, or elſe God will not juſtifie them but condemne them, Micha 6.10.11. They ſee they ſhall call their names in queſtion, they pretend ſlandering of the Goſpel. To theſe I ſay, <hi>Saul</hi> diſobeyed God, as he pretended to ſacrifice to God, or to have that he might, and not for private uſe; but it excuſed him not, he loſt his kingdome for it: let them take heed they loſe not the kingdome they ſay they hope and look for.</p>
                        <p>To teach every man when he hath a commandment of God, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> to obey, and not to caſt at the inconveniences, to hinder himſelfe from obeying: for he that will looke at ſuch things, ſhall be like him, Eccleſ. 11.4. He that obſerveth the winde, ſhall not ſow; and he that regardeth the clouds, ſhall not reap: he ſhall neither ſow any obedience, nor reap any reward. If he ſee no inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience imminent, and obey, it is not much worth: for he pleaſeth himſelfe rather then God; but if there be, it is the more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. As diſobedience in ſmall things is more offenſive, becauſe the obedience was eaſie: ſo obedience in great things, and when there are great inconveniences, is more acceptable, becauſe it is harder. Therefore if God command, we muſt ſhew our ſelves the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of the faithfull. What though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences will follow? what though the world ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us, and the wicked flout us, and the Divell and our owne fleſh ſet themſelves againſt us? Deny thy ſelfe as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, and thine owne reaſon; diſpute not of the commandment of God, but obey, and commit the event to God.

As it was in the time of Popery, when the Clergie was come to the height of wealth, yet they were in the wane and eb of worſhip and reſpect; nay, in ſhame and reproach: becauſe as in the morning, the neerer it is to the riſing of the Sun, the more light is in the aire, and the more are deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and things out of order eſpied: So as the Goſpell drew nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, that they were like <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, for deceiving the people, in contempt, with not affecting them to make them returne from their Idols to the living God. Therefore ſhame and confuſion came upon them, as we have ſeen. So of others, if they be in contempt, &amp;c. And as of them, ſo of Magiſtrates, and other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men.

Therefore ſhould he labour to lay it to his heart, and be humbled for it, and reformed by it: he ſhould be occaſioned by it to ſearch his wayes and his converſation. If it befall him for righteouſneſſe ſake, he hath wherein to rejoyce; if for his infirmities, and unjuſtly from thoſe who reproach him, yet he ſhould ſee whether it is not juſtly from God, or no: for that may be juſtly from him, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly from them. But if indeed juſtly for his diſſolute and looſe life; then is not to be expected any thing but the confuſion and deſtruction of his perſon, unleſſe that make him to humble and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme himſelfe: for when hard and bitter words prevail not, then maſters goe to beating and puniſhing with blowes.

Shewing, that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of a multitude ſhall not make the promiſe of God void, and of none effect; but he will perform them to the beleevers, and they who performe conditions, though they be but a very few.

                        <p>If in our obſervation we finde, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>1</label> that many promiſes God hath made, are not performed to our ſelves, or others. As there are many other things which may be anſwered for clearing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:151759:144"/>the truth and fidelity of God, in this kinde; eſpecially in temporall things; he gives ſpirituall, an ounce of which is better then many a pound of the other. And if he breaks not, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth ſilver, and gives the greater ſumme in gold: ſo not God. If he promiſe deliverance, and gives patience under the croſſe, which is better for the ſufferer, he ſtill performes, becauſe ſuch things had thoſe exceptions: And ſo in many other things, but this eſpecially, when the good things promiſed are not performed, the cauſe is in our ſelves and other men, why they are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and not in God; becauſe we performe not conditions. And this being, makes us, not him, covenant-breakers, who have made our ſelves uncapable, and unworthy of his bleſſings, and ſo have freed him from his promiſe, by our breaking with him. Now he that is freed, cannot breake covenant, though he do not the thing before covenanted.</p>
                        <p>To let us ſee the folly of thoſe men who thinke to have Gods promiſes performed unto them, <label type="milestone">

If the former be true, do they not deceive themſelves? and are they not (though how wiſe ſoever in other things, yet in this) ſtark fools? For if he be a foole, that becauſe he hath the word, or the bond of a good man, one able, and that never broke for the payment of a thouſand pounds at ſuch a time, and ſuch a place, but upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he performe ſuch a ſervice, or effect ſuch a worke, to lay his whole ſtate and his whole condition upon thta, that it will be performed in the ſame time and place; and yet he never go about to perform the conditions at all, or as it ſhould be performed; were he not a foole? Sure in all your judgements he were very unwiſe. And yet, alas! how many fools and unwiſe men have we, who deale thus, lay all upon Gods fidelitie, and performe nothing themſelves at all? As if God muſt needs performe, becauſe he had promiſed, and could not be faithfull, unleſſe he did perform, when they keep no condition. Many a man deluded by Satan, and his owne ſecure heart, perſwades himſelfe God hath been mercifull unto him, and forgiven him his ſins, though he never came truly to ſee ſinne, nor to ſorrow for ſinne, nor forſake and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his corruptions, wherein true repentance conſiſteth, and which is the condition on mans part, if ever he would have God take away his ſinne, and put them out of his remembrance. Many one thinkes God had performed his covenant of temporall things, becauſe he is in the middeſt of abundance, and hath his barnes full, and his bagges full, and every where findes he increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, though he never made any conſcience of his wayes, and the workes of God; but at beſt lived but civilly, and kept his credit
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:151759:145"/>with men: and ſees not that he is deceived, &amp; ſees that theſe are but things that are common things, wherewith he is but fatted for the ſhambles, and ſuch as are reſerved for his evill. And for time to come many doubt not but they ſhall obtaine great things in this life, and that God will give them honour, and favour, and riches and abundance, though they never keepe condition with him. Fools and blinde, who know they cannot live, except they eate; not reap, except they ſow; not recover health, except they uſe phyſicke, and the means appointed: And yet thinke, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the grand meanes and condition with God, they ſhall have what he hath promiſed; and ſo happily they may: But as Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael had a King in Gods wrath, and quails in his diſpleaſure: And as the Phyſitian gives his patient liberty to eate what he liſt, when he is out of all hope, and deſpaires of ever recovering him. Many a man perſwades himſelfe that God will ſave him, though he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was able to performe the condition of the Law, neither ever endeavoured to performe the condition of the Goſpell. Truly this is not to beleeve, but deceive himſelfe with an opinion of faith, he neither having the knowledge of the promiſes, the ground of it, nor workes the anſwerable fruits of it. And ſo hath but a vaine, fooliſh, and dead faith. But he ſhall know his folly, when God ſhall manifeſt unto him, that he is not bound to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form promiſe, becauſe he never kept condition.</p>

They are thereby liable to Gods judgements, as was <hi>Vzzah,</hi> 1 Chron. 13.10. and <hi>Vzziah,</hi> 2 Chron. 26.18.19.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe elſe the Church ſhould be too much burdened: <label type="milestone">

                        <p>Becauſe, 1 Cor. 14.40. <label type="milestone">

For if this be ſound and true, that muſt needs be falſe and corrupt, that any ſhould take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of this calling, without warrant from God, and beſides the order that God hath appointed. Yet I deny not but there is a difference where a Church is not yet planted, where every one that knowes Chriſt may preach him, and labour to gaine others that are ignorant of Chriſtian religion, and are not to look for an ordinary ordination. For then is he choſen by the ſilent ſuffrages and voices of thoſe who heare, and that is his calling; yet is he not to refuſe the ordinary calling, if after it be to be had. But when a Church is already planted, and eſtabliſhed; becauſe all things muſt bee done in order, then is required an apparent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination by voyces or impoſition of hands; that trouble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion might be avoided. Neither do I deny, but ſometime there is an extraordinary function, as were the Prophets, not of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viticall ſtocke, not ordained of the Prieſts, which God ſtirred up, when ordinary Miniſters could not reforme the corruptions of the time; but what he did extraordinarily, is to be admired rather then imitated: For we muſt follow the preſcript rule that is given us, which is, that every man have his ordinary calling which is from God by men.</p>

A man promiſeth ten acres of ground in one field, and gives him an hundreth in another, he hath not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his promiſe.

So that it had beene better for them never to have beene borne, or elſe to have dyed ſo ſoone as they were borne; for the longer they live, the more ſinnes they commit, and the greater ſhall be their torments. But greater ſhall be his glory that is found in the way of righteouſneſſe and in wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing becauſe he hath more glorified God. And he ought ſtill to

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:151759:151"/>upon theſe Prieſts; namely, their diſſimilitude with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and firſt Prieſts, with whom he made the covenant, and to whom he did performe it, <hi>Aaron, Eleazar, Phineas.</hi> And in this the order obſerved is, he ſetteth downe in the firſt part of the compariſon, their good and worthy parts which were the prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, verſ. 6. and the reaſon of it, verſ. 7. There are foure worthy parts reckoned of theirs. And theſe were not of private and particular parts, as they were private men; but they were ſuch parts as were in them as publicke perſons: As if it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the former, he ſaid, he did not onely carry himſelfe and approve himſelfe a good and godly man; but he ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a wiſe and compleat Doctor, both in teaching the Law and Truth of God, and giving moſt wiſe, grave, and wholeſome counſell.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The law of truth was in his mouth.]</hi> The firſt part of the prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, which was commendable in them, he was ever moſt ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious of the law of God, and moſt skilfull in it, and taught it moſt ſincerely to his people, ever teaching moſt ſound doctrine to them, that they might obſerve my precepts.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And there was no iniquity found in his lips.]</hi> The ſecond thing commendable; he never propounded or taught any errour, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deceived any of my people to draw them from my true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but taught ever that which was wholſome and good. Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is commonly taken for the pervertion and depravation of the knowne right, and is oppoſite to equity and truth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>He walked with me in peace and equitie.]</hi> The third thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; the ſumme of it is, he lived and performed the duty of his place without all negligence &amp; unfaithfulneſſe, approving himſelfe to God and men. He walkes with me, i. he was moſt carefull to pleaſe me, and to approve himſelfe unto me, to worſhip me as I required, and followed not the wickedneſſe of the age, nor was corrupted with the depravations of the time, whereby men were depraved in my ſervice and feare, as Gen. 5.22.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In peace.]</hi> That is peaceably, not provoking me to anger; but cleaving faſt unto me, and obeying my will, ſo that I had no cauſe of expoſtulating or quarrelling with him. <hi>Cyril</hi> ſaith, To have peace with God, is nothing elſe but to deſire to know and do that which God requires, and to offend him in nothing.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And did turn many from iniquity.]</hi> The fourth thing commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable in them, was, that by their exact walking, and faithfull tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, they helped to turne others from their ſinfull wayes. Out of the coherence, that from their perſonall and inherent vertues, he proceeds to the vertues of their place, and their publicke acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and carriages; we may note:</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:151759:151"/>publicke, he muſt be good &amp; faithfull in that, if hee would be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of God: As if he be a Magiſtrate, or Miniſter, or officer, or maſter of a family. As this is manifeſt in the coherence: ſo by that, Gen. 18.17.18.19. &amp; Exo 18.19.20.21. Hence is both the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations &amp; blemiſh of old <hi>Eli,</hi> he was a good Prieſt, a good Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, but a bad father; in the more publicke, good; in the leſſe, defective, 1 Sam. 1.2. Hence we read in Scripture, the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of good governours, and Kings, both for their private parts, and their publicke vertues: In themſelves fearing God, and in publick diſcharging their duties ſufficiently and faithfully. And in the new Teſtament we finde not onely private and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall duties preſcribed to Maſters, Fathers, Husbands, to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Magiſtrates; but ſpecially publicke, Epheſ. 5. and 6. Col. 3. and 4. 1 Tim. 3.2. &amp;c. Tit. 1.6. Hence the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Angell of the Church of Epheſus, though he was defective in perſonall, Rev. 2.2. and the reproofe of the Angell of Pergamus, verſes 14.15.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe he more glorifies God: for though his good workes, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> as a private man, do glorifie God; yet nothing ſo much as his faithfulneſſe in his place publicke, which makes that God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified much more, and of more.

But of few fathers of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies can God ſay as of <hi>Abraham;</hi> nay, he knowes the contrary, that they tooke the place with no minde to do any ſuch dutie, and ſo execute it ſtill. So of Magiſtrates and Miniſters. They are brought, or thruſt themſelves, before they be called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtage of the world; and when they are on it, do no more then make a dumb ſhew, perform no more then lookers on, or but things that muſt be done of courſe, and would be though they ſlept: which is the fault not onely of men profane, or but civilly honeſt; but of men who profeſſe the feare of God; and may well be thought to have ſome good meaſure of it, and go for good and truly honeſt men. Yet it is their blemiſh, that they are careleſſe of the duties of their place. That as he ſaid, An evill man may be a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:151759:152"/>good Citizen: we may ſay, Good men are evill Citizens, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, &amp;c. which blemiſheth much their private graces in the ſight of God and good men. And upon many hath, and doth, and will bring particular and temporall judgements, from their families, and ſervants, &amp;c. For this is a grand cauſe why good men, fathers of families, have ſuch graceleſſe children, and corrupt ſervants, Miniſters ſuch untoward flockes, Magiſtrates ſuch people.</p>
                        <p>This may admoniſh and inſtruct all that have the faith and feare of God, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> to joyne with it this care of the duties of their place whatſoever it is; that they muſt have, becauſe theſe duties though they be profitable for the common good, yet are they not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table from him. As he ſaith, <hi>Cyprianſec. de zela &amp; livore,</hi> that performeth holy things and is not a conſecrated Prieſt, doth things in reſpect of himſelfe, childiſh and unprofitable though they may be good to others. So he that doth things without faith and the feare of God, they are unprofitable; yea wicked and damnable ſinnes, howſoever they may benefit others; ſo may I ſay of theſe; but yet this had, will not beare out, nor excuſe the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and not doing the duties of his place. It may make the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of them paſſed over, but not defend the omitting of them. Therefore to be accepted of God, men muſt alſo be carefull of that: Maſters, &amp;c. The excuſes that commonly are pretended will not goe for currant; ſervants will not abide with me, if I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, correct, and reſtraine them, as duty and reaſon requireth. Firſt, ſee whether thou art not the cauſe why they are ſo untracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, either not ſeeking by prayer a bleſſing upon thy government, or dealing hardly and paſſionately in thy government, as if thou hated them, rather then loved good things, or thy ſervants ſee thee doe contrary to that thou directs them; for if none of theſe, God will perſwade them to be tractable and bend their hearts, or elſe know that he would have thee purge thy houſe of them, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid and did his, of his ſaid lewd ſervants; leſt as God proſpers a bad houſhold for a good ſervant, ſo he curſe a good houſhold for a bad ſervant. Miniſters excuſes of the untractableneſſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe of their people which may happily come from their former negligence, or indiſcretion; or if God doe not bleſſe his labours to them, his reward ſhall be never a whit the leſſe, nor he leſſe acceptable, ſo he doe his duty. Magiſtrates and Officers, that they ſhall be accounted buſie, officious, and pragmaticall, and it may be when they are out of their office they ſhall have actions againſt them for this and that uſage; they may happily be juſtly ſo accounted, becauſe they follow and doe things in humour not in conſcience. If they doe not, they neede not doubt of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and of good ſucceſſe, and ſhould rather feare an action from God then men, beſides the loſſe of the good they may have by doing it. But to all I ſay as ſhe ſaid to the Heathen King, <hi>doe me
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:151759:152"/>juſtice, or elſe ceaſe to be my King.</hi> So let them either doe the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their places or elſe never take them, or ſpeedily give them over, and leave to be maſters, &amp;c.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:151759:153"/>to teach it, cap. 4.2. To deliver the whole counſell of God. But no man knowes the whole counſell of God, how can he deliver it to others, and many have not life and time to deliver it? If any man know it not by his owne fault, not ſearching for it, not ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and endevouring, it will not excuſe him, but condemne him the more. If God hide ſomething from him, it is, without doubt, ſuch a thing as is not ſo profitable to be knowne or taught, and not required of him.

If any ſay, they are not able to conceive, and are not capable of it: I anſwere, their children at firſt are not capable of all the learning the School-maſter can teach them; yet at length, and by ſucceſſe and progreſſe, he learnes as much as he can teach him, and is fit for a higher Schoole: So may it be with them. The wit and capacity of man is compared by one, to the wombe of a woman, which at the firſt is not able to containe the infant, if it were at firſt conception as perfect for quantity, as when it is borne: but as parts are added to parts, ſo is it enlarged; ſo they, when Chriſt is formed in them.</p>

(A monſtrous body which had three heads or no head.) He anſweres ſecondly, that he had no ſuch errour imputed to him for certaine: for, ſaith he, there were 53. Articles put up againſt him; but all touching his life and manners, and were proved by witneſſe. And other Articles were objected without witneſſe, whereof this was one. Then was he found faultie in his manners in 53. crimes. His third anſwer is, that this was onely proved againſt him by the rumour of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, who ſeeing <hi>Iohn</hi> of ſo diſſolute a life, begun to think and to ſpeak it abroad, that he beleeved neither eternall life, nor the reſurrection of the body: for it had been unpoſſible he ſhould have lived ſo, if he had been perſwaded of either.

This is his dutie, and he that is a Prieſt, and rebukes not delinquents, he forſakes the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Prieſt. In the doing of it faithfully, he may well expect a bleſſing from God; becauſe of that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55.10.11. Surely, as the raine commeth downe, and the ſnow from heaven, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it to bring forth and bud, that it might give ſeed to the ſower, and bread to him that eateth: ſo ſhal my word be, that goeth out of my mouth: it ſhall not returne unto me void, but it ſhall accompliſh that which I will, and it ſhall proſper in the thing whereto I ſend it: And if he doe waſte himſelfe, hazard his life, and ſpend his ſtrength, and gain but one, or few, it will be the recompence of his labour. The Captaine that redeems and recovers but one captive, whoſe free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is deſired by his Prince, ſhall not loſe his reward, though he ſhall have greater that recovers more. So in this. Dan. 12.3. And if God do not bleſſe his labours, yet if he be not wanting in his dutie, care and endeavour, but be found wiſe and faithfull, he ſhall be rewarded. Iſai. 49.5. And now, ſaith the Lord that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med me from the womb to be his ſervant, that I may bring <hi>Iacob</hi> again to him, though Iſrael be not gathered, yet ſhall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God ſhall be my ſtrength.</p>
                        <p>This may teach us why the Miniſtery of the Word, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> and the Miniſters of it, are ſo harſh and ſo unacceptable unto moſt men, if they be faithfull, and will ſeeke by all means to convert men to God; becauſe they muſt turne them from their ſin, ſeparate them and their iniquities, which they love ſo dearly, as Micha 6.7. Sin is either naturall, or by cuſtome, or both; naturall diſeaſes are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt incurable, and no leſſe diſeaſes that grow into a cuſtome, which is another nature: And the Phyſitian that ſhould go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to cure theſe againſt a mans will, ſhould have little thanke for his paines, and be not greatly welcome, when ſuch things cannot be removed without moſt ſharp and bitter medicines, great paine and griefe: So in this. And here is the cauſe why many a mans miniſtery at the firſt comming to a place, is very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable for a while, becauſe he ſpeakes things good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, but ſomewhat generally, becauſe he knowes not the ſtate of his flocke and people: but after he hath lived ſome yeares, and ſees their ſinnes, and begins to ſpeake home unto them; then is he unacceptable, becauſe he would part them and their ſins. As that Miniſter that ſhould perſwade a divorce betwixt a man &amp; his wife which he loves moſt dearly, ſhould never be welcome to his houſe or company: ſo in this. It may be it is but the ſame he hath
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:151759:157"/>often ſpoke of before, but then it was borne; becauſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably conjectured, he meant not them, but when he hath been a while with them: that it is like he may know them to be guilty of that ſinne, though happily, and ten to one, he did not, then is it tolerable, becauſe they thinke he would ſeparate them and their beloved ſinne, their profitable and delightfull ſinne. All the while he will preach peace and comfortable things to them, and bring the word of reconciliation, and tell them of Gods love, and Gods mercie, and that he is ſent to wooe them to be married to God: all that while he ſhall be kindly welcome. As he that ſhould ſue for a Prince, to win the love of a woman to him, all the while he tells of his honour and riches, and beauty, and ſuch things, he ſhall be kindly welcome: but if he come to tell her, that ſhe muſt ſeparate her ſelfe from ſome place and company ſhe loves well, and change her manners, and forſake her friends and fathers houſe; he ſhall finde his entertainment, both for uſage and countenance, changed: So in this. Which makes oftentimes Miniſters, if they be not the more faithfull, grow cold and careleſſe, and ſo fall into many grievous ſins.</p>

It depends upon the former thus:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:151759:158"/>Theſe things he ought to do: for he ought to be a man of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, &amp;c. Some read them, <hi>Doth preſerve,</hi> in the preſent tenſe; but commonly it is read in the future: Not to note out a promiſe, as if the Prieſts lips ſhould never erre, but ſhould be ſo kept, that he might not erre. But it is a commandement, ſhewing how he ought to be qualified.</p>

                        <p>In the verſe we obſerve two things, two duties, and one reaſon inforcing both. The firſt is the Miniſters duty, he muſt be a man of knowledge, learning and underſtanding.</p>
                        <p>The Miniſter of God, <label type="milestone">

                           </label> he that is to go in and out before Gods people, ought to be a man of learning, knowledge, and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the word of God, and of the myſteries there delivered. It is ſo here commanded. This <hi>Eliſha</hi> knew well, therefore 2 King. 2.9. he asked a double portion of <hi>Elijahs</hi> ſpirit. Matth. 13.52. Every Scribe which is taught unto the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is like unto an houſholder, which bringeth forth out of his treaſure, things both new and old. Therefore are they compared to ſtarres, Rev. 2.1. Made the light of the world, Matth. 5.14. To prove that ſtarres ſhould have light, that the eye ſhould have ſight, were needleſſe: for all know and will confeſſe it, Tit. 1.9. Gods ſtewards, of whom as they muſt be faithfull, 1 Cor. 4.2. ſo alſo skilfull, ſeeing he hath the keyes of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Haggai 1.13. he is the Lords meſſenger. 2 Cor. 5.20. in Gods ſtead.</p>

                        <p>But this cannot be done, except he be a man of knowledge and underſtanding of the word.</p>
                        <p>This admoniſheth all thoſe, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> who are by God and Man, God and his Church, put in truſt, and credited with the choyce and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of fit men for this calling and function, that they impoſe not hands upon any, neither admit any to this place, but ſuch as are able men, ſuch as after triall &amp; examination are found fit and ſufficient for it.

                        <p>This reproveth thoſe who thinke any body ſufficient for the Miniſtery: As corrupt Patrons and Parents and ſuch like; ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Patrons to enrich themſelves, and better their ſtate and portion, thinke any body ſufficient to diſcharge, if he can change <hi>Peters</hi> voyce, Acts 3.6. <hi>Silver and gold have I ſtore;</hi> or if he want that, if he can part ſtakes, and divide it, take thirds, or ſtand to his courteſie, though he have not a whit of <hi>Eliſha's</hi> ſpirit, nor any knowledge in his lips; ſuch a one, if they may be judges, there is none to him, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Goliahs</hi> ſword, and more fit then one that hath <hi>Eliſha's</hi> double ſpirit doubled upon him, and will looke as he may to have that which God hath given him. If we will make them judges, either the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> forgot himſelfe, or the Printer, by negligence left out a word, 2 Corinth. 2.16. for it ſhould be, <hi>Who is not ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> But theſe <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boams,</hi> which bring in Miniſters of the lower ſort of the people;

                           </note>To this I anſwer: It is no promiſe, but a commandment, ſhewing what manner of man a Miniſter ought to bee: The ſame which the next ſentence is.</p>
                        <p>Againe, I affirme, that if it be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, it is generall: for the reaſon is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to all, yea and particular to every one. But the Scripture is manifeſt, that both particular Prieſts, and generall Councels of Prieſts have erred. In general are theſe, Iſaiah 59.10. Jerem. 6.13. and 14.14. which places ſhew, that the moſt of the Prieſts and Prophets were then corrupt. Now if there ſhould have been a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell gathered of theſe, what good might be hoped for from them, by going to the Councell; they might have changed their places, but not their mindes; they would have been the ſame in a Councell they were at home. Beſides, is it not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that Councels have erred? 1 Kings 22. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> happily will anſwere, they were a Councell of Prophets, not Prieſts, gathered by the King, not the high Prieſt. Then ſee a Councel of Prieſts ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by the high Prieſt erring, John 9.22. and 11.53. and Mark 14.64. But <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> will ſay, that a Councell of the Jewes lawfully called before Chriſt, could not erre; but he being come, they might. The ground muſt be, becauſe they are not Prieſts, neither the high Prieſt; but this is falſe: for the Prieſtood of <hi>Aaron</hi> was not aboliſhed till Chriſt became a Prieſt, which was not till his ſacrifice: for if they had been, then had he ſinned in communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with them. And if this were ſo, it were marvell how the Rhemiſts, and the generall Popiſh argument will hold, who by the example of <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> Joh. 11.49. proves, that the Pope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre, though he be wicked: for if he were not a high Prieſt, then holds not this argument; but he was a high Prieſt, and they all Prieſts, and yet they erred, and ſo may it erre.

It is not ſpoken excluſively, as if theſe muſt onely heare from the Miniſter, and not to read themſelves: for that is commanded, Joh. 5.39. but principally they muſt heare it from him, and ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when he ſpeaketh the Word, they muſt not withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but muſt heare. This is the order God hath ordained in his Church: This is that is commanded here: ſo Hag. 2.12. ſo Jam. 1.16. Iſaiah 2.3. To Gods houſe to heare and be taught, there ſpeake the Miniſters, Heb. 13.17. Then muſt they be heard.</p>

                        <p>This will convince of ſinne all thoſe who hold either in opinion or practice, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> no ſuch neceſſity of reſorting to the publicke Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, where the Law is to be had from the mouth of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: for if it be a duty that they ſhould, then muſt it be a ſinne to thinke they ought not, and to withdraw themſelves from it; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning the miniſtery of the Word, being the ordinance of God, by which he would teach them the Law. Their pretences they hold forth in their defence, are vaine: Firſt, they can read at home, and it may be, better Sermons then he they ſhould heare, can preach any. Let me grant them they can; yet followes it not they will: for he that accounts little of Gods publicke ordinance, will hardly performe any ſuch private dutie, mans nature being more apt to publicke then private duties. But ſay they can, and will, and doe it, yet is it faultie, becauſe it is croſſe to Gods commandment, who could as well have commanded private at that time, as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke. And though it be in it ſelfe good, yet being out of it fit time, it is evill. It is good and lawfull for a man to follow his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or to build Churches, or to get in his harveſt, or to recreate himſelfe in their times; but to do theſe upon the Lords day, is evill. As in the body, the bloud, that is the continent of life, is good, ſo it be in the proper veſſels, the veines: but if out, it is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and breeds putrifactions and diſeaſes. And as all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are good in their proper place, but one in another is mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, and hurtfull, as the finger upon the hand, and in the eye: ſo it is of theſe things. Againe, what is this, but to croſſe the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God? What is it elſe but to chalenge more wiſedome
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:151759:160"/>to themſelves, then God hath, who hath commanded it, who hath given Paſtors and Teachers to the Church, who hath bid them preach in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, they are begotten already, therefore they need not heare. Nay, they are therefore not begotten, becauſe they think it needleſſe. For there cannot be life, but ther <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Thirdly, you cannot prove we ought to heare ſo often. Thou muſt learne and heare from him the whole Law of God, which cannot be heard in a mans life in ſo ſeldome hearing, as they can bee content onely to hear, and much leſſe learned. If they muſt heare out of ſeaſon, then oftner then they would, or do. But ſhall I tell you the true cauſe of this refuſall? It is either pride of heart, whereby they are puffed up with their owne knowledge, and condition, and thinke they know as much and need no more, and are, as the ſpeech is, as well as meat can make them; which is plain hypocriſie: or it is pride of ſtate, when they are puffed up with their wealth and ſtate, and thinke it enough for the poore to receive the Goſpell, and preſſe upon it. It is not for their ſtate and worſhip to be over attendant, to ſtrive and thirſt after the Word, they come more to honour the Word, or to be well thought of by men, then for any good they look to receive by it; which is a ſpice of Atheiſme: or it is becauſe of the guilt of their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who finde the galling of the Word, who thinke if they ſhould continually heare it, they ſhould have no quietneſſe in themſelves at all, when they can hardly quiet themſelves that heare ſo ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which is carnall ſecurity; or elſe he that hath them in a ſnare at his will, is afraid to loſe them: And when he findes that one Sermon makes <hi>Agrippa</hi> almoſt a Chriſtian, he is afraid of a conſtant hearing, leſt they ſhould become Chriſtians altogether, and he be caſt out, knowing the Preacher is the power of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                        <p>To teach every one to make conſcience of this duty, <label type="milestone">

Therfore ſhould we be glad with <hi>David,</hi> to go into the houſe of God, ſo ſhall we ſubſcribe to the wiſedome of God, who hath ſo ordained, and given men gifts, not in vaine, not for themſelves, when as little would ſave them, but as teats to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Art to the Bee to make hony, &amp;c. ſo ſhall we be begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of God, to be ſonnes, or reformed of God to be holy ſonnes,

And hence are the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons when it made as milke and men as new borne Babes, 1 Pet. 2. when, it is compared to gold, Rev. 2.18. to a treaſure, and men to purchaſers, Matth. 13.44. to pearles, and men to Merchants, verſ. 45.46.</p>

Jeſus ſaid to the twelve, Will ye alſo go away? <hi>Peter</hi> anſwered, Lord, to whom ſhall we goe? Thou haſt the words of eternall life.

There are ſome who think many things needleſſe to be knowne and heard, many things not fit to be taught, as before v. 6. Beſides that was then ſayd, I ſay, let them ſee if this be not to check the wiſedome of God, who hath written both, and preſerved the whole to the Church; and if pride did not tranſport them beyond themſelves, it could not be they ſhould be ſo affected. As wiſedome would teach them that many things are neceſſary, though not the preſent profit of them appeare. For as in inſtruments onely the ſtrings ſound, yet are there other things in the whole body, as that whereunto they are tied, the bridge, the pinnes, which help the muſicke: ſo in the Prophets, though all be not propheſies, yet they are things to which theſe are tied and illuſtrated. <hi>Aug de Civ. D. lib.</hi> 16.2. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for thoſe things which ſignifie ſomething, are thoſe things which ſignifie nothing added. As the ground is onely plowed and rent up by the plow ſhare, yet that this may be, other parts of the plow are neceſſary. And humility, if they had any, would teach to ſuſpect their owne wiſedome, in not ſeeing the uſe and end, the profit and fitneſſe of things, rather then queſtioning and reaſoning againſt God. Others can be content to heare all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant things, as the promiſes and mercies of God, but judgements and reprooſes, threats and checks, that they cannot brooke; like unto thoſe, who in medicines affect onely the ſmell or trimneſſe, or gayneſſe of them, as pills rouled in gold, but cannot away with the force of purging and preſerving. And ſee not that a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany more go to hell by preſuming in their lives, then by deſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at their deaths. Some can willingly heare that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes other men, and their ſinnes, their lives and manners, but nothing touching themſelves at all, and their owne ſinnes: As men can willingly abide to heare of other mens deaths; but cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide to heare of their owne. Oftentimes they will make the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to beleeve as they did, Jerem. 42.5.6.7. Then they ſaid to <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> The Lord be a witneſſe of truth and faith between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the Lord thy God ſhall ſend thee to us, whether it be good or evill, we will obey the voyce of the Lord God, to whom we ſend thee, that it may be well with us, when we obey the voyce of the Lord our
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:151759:162"/>God. But when he ſhall declare unto them the will of God, that croſſeth their affections, they will entertaine him and anſwer, as Chap. 43.2. Thou ſpeakeſt falſly, the Lord hath not ſent thee to ſay thus. Theſe and ſuch like are here reproved and convinced of the breach of this duty, that they receive not, nor deſire the Law of God.</p>

And indeed it is fearfull: for it argues, he was either an hypocrite before, or elſe by reaſon of ſome ſecurity and careleſneſſe over his own ſpirituall eſtate, he is fallen into a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all diſeaſe and ſome ſins he had not before; and refuſing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies or the bitter potion which ſhould recover him, he muſt needs putrifie more. The body that is ſicke, and the part that is wounded, if either the remedy be rejected, or the ſalve be pulled off when it is applied, will doubtleſſe grow worſe. As he that is ſore ſicke, and grievouſly wounded, gives hope of his recovery, while he will ſubmit himſelfe to his Phyſitian, and take whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he preſcribes him: but he that is but a little ill, and refuſeth to hearken or receive any thing, gives no hope at all, though his hurt be the leſſe: So in this.

                           <p>But yee are gone out of the way: yee have cauſed many to fall by the Law: yee have broken the covenant of Levi, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>BVt yee are gone out of the way.]</hi> Or, <hi>Yee have departed from that way.</hi> The ſecond part of this diſſimilitude followes now in this and the next verſe, which containes their degenerating, and ſo their corruption, verſ. 8. and the iteration of the judgement, verſ. 9. And in the 8. verſe there are three corruptions, theſe Prieſts be chalenged withall, wherein they are moſt unlike to the former Prieſts. <hi>You are gone out of that way:</hi> that is, from the piety and faithfulneſſe of thoſe Prieſts who lived in the firſt age, and with whom I made the covenant at firſt. They neither ſwarved from that rule, but you have forſaken and contemned my law, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed your owne devices, and ſought your ſelves and the eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of your dignity more then my glory, and have ſought how to make a gaine to your ſelves of my worſhip: You have done this who have the ſame place, enjoy the ſame priviledges, have the ſame portion of tythes and offerings they had.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Yee have cauſed many to fall by the Law.]</hi> The ſecond diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and diffimilitude: That whereas the former Prieſts by their care and diligence in their places, recovered and cauſed many to returne from their ſinnes, and the breaches of the Law, and to walk uprightly by it: They on the contrary, by their defect and want in teaching, and their paſſing over their ſinnes as if they ſaw them not, that they might purchaſe grace, and procure commoditie to themſelves. As alſo by their wicked example they were the cauſe of the fall of many; that is, that many have ſinned, and were not puniſhed, as the word ſometime ſignifies. By the Law, is not meant, as if they did ſo teach and temper the Law as ſometime the Prieſts did, in giving liberty by it to ſinne, as to hate their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to luſt and covet, ſo nothing were outwardly acted: but that they cauſed many to ſtumble and go contrary to the Law.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Yee have broken the covenant of Levi.]</hi> The third difference: They kept my covenant and were faithfull, and I performed whatſoever I promiſed to them; but you have broken covenant, &amp; gone cleane contrary to the agreement which paſſed betwixt me
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:151759:163"/>and your predeceſſours in whoſe loynes you were, and who made the covenant for you; and ſo by your iniquities have cauſed me not to performe to you peace, plenty and proſperity, with length of dayes. From the generall I obſerve this:</p>
                        <p>Men, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                           </label> of what ſort and condition ſoever they be, ought to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and follow the vertue, pietie, and faith of their predeceſſours, whether they were in place, nature, or age. And on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it is a great wickedneſſe and ſhame to degenerate from their pietie and vertue, to be unlike unto them. Therefore reproves our Prophet theſe Prieſts. To this purpoſe is that Heb. 6.12. and 13.7. and 12.1. inferred upon the 11. and Jam. 5.11. Hence was the commendations of <hi>Iehoſaphat,</hi> 1 King. 22.43. and of <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> 2 King. 22.2. On the contrary, it was reproved in <hi>Iehoram,</hi> 2 Chron. 21.12. and in the Jewes, Joh. 8.39.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe God hath therefore written theſe; <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> he hath written not that they ſhould be knowne as matter of ſtory, to be made for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light or ſpeech onely; but for matter of life and converſation: thereby teaching us what to do in others whoſe memory is new and freſh, that God may have his end.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe it will not profit them to have deſcended from, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon, </seg>2</label> or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſuch: for as he ſaid of Nobility, what profiteth it a chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell or river, flowing from a pure and wholeſome ſpring, if it be corrupt and defiled? Nay, it will the more condemne them, as we may well gather from that, Matth. 12.41.42.</p>
                        <p>Then are they juſtly reproved, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> who talk of doing as their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers have done, being neither willing nor able to examine what they did, good or evill; but is all one to them, ſo they did it before them. Such as our ignorant Papiſts be, who imitate not the faith, but the infidelity and errours of their fathers; not their vertues and pietie, but their vices and prophaneneſſe, their liberty and licenciouſneſſe. No man will condemne their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that is good in them, or rather that which had but the ſhew of goodneſſe in them; as their workes which were good for the outward act, though not otherwiſe, their workes of mercie and liberality, their zeale, fervencie, and diligence in prayer, though their prayers not to be imitated; as a man may imitate the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and watchfulneſſe of a thiefe, but not his theft: the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a bad Steward, but not his corruption. But to imitate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing they have done, without choyce of their good, is that which is juſtly condemned: For if the Apoſtle muſt not, nor will not be otherwiſe followed, then 1 Corinth. 11.1. as he followes Chriſt. If the Prophet forbid us to follow our fathers, if they are condemned for following their fore-fathers, as did all the Kings of Iſrael. If that be the commendations of <hi>Iehoſaphat,</hi> 2 Chro. 17.3. that he walked in the firſt way of his father <hi>David,</hi> and not that he imitated him in all things. Is it approveable to follow thoſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:151759:163"/>who are farre inferiour to him in all things? Nay, it is that which ſhall improve their ſin, and inhance their puniſhment, as Iſai. 14.21. with 65.7.</p>

Let us look into the booke of God, and we ſhall finde this true, not in ſome one or two, but in the greateſt part of them; yea all, for ought we know. Firſt, theſe things were fore-told: for though the people bragged, Jer. 18.18. <hi>The Law ſhould not periſh from the Prieſt, nor counſell from the wiſe:</hi> God threatned the farre contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Ezek. 7.26. and Micha. 3.6. <hi>That the Sunne ſhould go downe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Prieſt.</hi> And ſee the event of this, Iſa. 56.10. Zephan. 3.4. Jerem. 6.13. and 23.13. But this was in Iſrael onely: yea, ſee it in Judah, Jerem 23.14.16. and not in Prophets onely but Prieſts, 2 Chron. 36.14.</p>

Rom. 7.17.24 Therefore may they in part ſtrive againſt their owne judgement, and be drawne by temptation to defend errour. Sometime againſt their owne conſcience: for though errour in judgement, ariſe ever of ignorance; yet errour in act, as in teaching, in defending and maintaining of error, is joyned often with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ariſeth not out of ignorance, but want of grace and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe the promiſe of inceſſant aſſiſtance, <label type="milestone">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:151759:164"/>Chriſtians nor as teachers, which they had already but as Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. 1. To be planters of new Churchs, and new government. Now that this was promiſed to them onely, I prove; for it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he will ſhew you the things to come; a priviledge that no Pope or Patriarch ever durſt challenge; and if not this will paſſe by vertue of that promiſe, why the other, when they are both in one and the ſame promiſe: therefore it was to them alone; yea not ſo much as the extraordinary Prophets of the old Teſtament, had it either promiſed or performed, as <hi>Greg. ſuper</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 3.8. obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth: for they had not the Spirit extraordinarily alwayes infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly guiding them, ſave when they came with ſome ſpeciall meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from God, which is manifeſt by the errour of <hi>Nathan,</hi> when he was out of his meſſage, 2 Sam. 7.3. And of him that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by the falſe Prophet after he had done his meſſage to <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> and made to tranſgreſſe the commandment of the Lord, 1 King. 13.2.18. and 19. which he would not have done if he had not been deceived: for before he would not do it for all the Kings offer, verſ. 7.8. and in Jer. cap. 42.4.7.</p>
                        <p>This ſerves to confute the doctrine of Popery, <label type="milestone">

                           </label> who hold, that the Church cannot erre, nor a Councell, which is the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Church; but they have brought it to a narrower ſcantling: for the queſtion is wholly about one, for whatſoever they talke of Church or Councels, it commeth in concluſion all home to the Pope, he it is alone that cannot erre: For the Church, they grant that any particular Church in the world may erre, ſave the Curch of Rome; &amp; that too, if the Pope ſhould tranſlate his Sea from Rome, as <hi>Peter</hi> did from Antioch thither, <hi>Bell. de Pont. Rom.</hi> 4.4. For Councels, that a generall Councel may erre, if the Pope do not confirme it. <hi>Ibid.</hi> 4.3. And <hi>è contra Idem de Conc. author</hi> 2.2.5. But if all be true that we have ſhewed, he may erre. But <hi>Bellar. de Pontif Rom.</hi> 4.3. proveth he cannot: for Luke 22.32. <hi>I have prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not,</hi> and ſo for the Pope, and ſo he cannot erre. It is anſwered: Firſt, that by faith is not heere meant an hiſtoricall faith, but a juſtifying faith; not a generall faith, but a particular; nor that by which we beleeve God, but in God: which fails not by errour, ſo it be not fundamentall: for ſo ſhould we condemne all who ever have lived: But when a man doth fall wholly from grace, and ceaſeth to be a member of Chriſt. And that it is ſo, appeares out of the drift and ſcope of our Saviour Chriſt. for his drift was to arme and protect <hi>Peter</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that triall and temptation that he then foretold him of: not againſt errour in teaching the Church, but againſt Apoſtaſie in time of triall. Therefore ſaith <hi>Theophilact in Lucam,</hi> he ſheweth him the particular temptation: for our Saviour would not arme there where he was not to be hurt, where there was no danger: not put an helmet upon the head when the heart and breaſt was to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:151759:164"/>be ſtrucken. And thus much <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth, when he makes <hi>Peters</hi> fall to be a matter of fact, to caſt utterly off his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer profeſſion, and not of faith; and therefore it was perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the habit of juſtifying faith, not infallibility in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of hiſtoricall faith that Chriſt prayed for; which ſo differs, that a man may have the one, that is, juſtifying faith, and yet hold an errour not fundamentall to the death, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> contends for the Fathers, divers of them. And the other, that is a right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of the generall points of religion, and yet not have juſtifying faith, nor ſaving and ſanctifying grace, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> contendeth the Pope cannot erre, and yet confeſſeth he may want ſaving grace.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it is anſwered, that that he prayed for here, was a thing not proper to <hi>Peter,</hi> but common to all the Apoſtles, yea all the elect; and if the gift and grace be common to all, and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, Joh. 17.9.10.20. by the ſame perſon in effect the ſame for all: upon which ground the ancient Fathers apply this place to all the Apoſtles; yea to all the elect: and if to all, then helps it them but a little.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond proofe he cannot erre, is Matth. 16.18. The gates of hell ſhall not prevaile againſt the Church: whence they firſt reaſon, that the foundation and roofe of the Church cannot erre: ſuch as <hi>Peter</hi> and the Popes his ſucceſſors. I ſay nothing that it is not yet proved, that the Pope is <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor: nay, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that he ſucceeded rather <hi>Simon Magus</hi> then <hi>Simon Peter.</hi> But I ſay, that <hi>Peter</hi> is not the rocke. In the words, ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> there is difference betwixt <hi>Petrus</hi> and <hi>Petra,</hi> both in the Greeke and Latine. Againe, the rocke here is not <hi>Peter,</hi> but Chriſt, 1 Cor. 10.4. and 3.11. whereunto agrees the Fathers, and their owne writers, &amp; alſo late writers; whereby all colour of argument taken from this place for the Pope, is utterly quaſhed. But grant that they begge: then muſt it either be in regard of his perſon; but that cannot be: for the Church cannot be builded upon fleſh and bloud; Or in regard of ſome ſuperioritie and place above the reſt. But as that cannot be proved: ſo the contrary is manifeſt, 2. Cor. 12.11. Or of his doctrine taught by him, and of the faith of Chriſt confeſſed by him, and ſo it is true. Now this was common to him and all the reſt. For as <hi>Iohn</hi> is called a Pillar, Gal. 2.9. ſo was <hi>Iames</hi> as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> and all the reſt, as Revel. 21.14. To which is that, Epheſ. 2.20. with whom the Prophets are joyned, becauſe they writ the Scriptures, which is indeed the foundation of our faith; they being put for their writings. Out of all which nothing will follow for the Pope, or nothing in ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                        <p>I will trouble you with no other reaſons, onely I will ſhew you this chalenge is falſe, becauſe many of them have erred. The firſt

The ſecond <hi>Liberius,</hi> whom <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Athanaſius</hi> affirme to have been an Arrian, one that denied the Deity of Chriſt. Thirdly, Thirdly, like to him was <hi>Felix,</hi> who was an Arrian, as the ſame <hi>Hierom</hi> writeth. <hi>Innocent</hi> the firſt made both Baptiſme and the Euchariſt neceſſary to ſalvation of infants. <hi>Auguſtine lib.</hi> 1. <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Iulian.

Fourthly, <hi>Leo</hi> the firſt, who died as <hi>Arrius</hi> did, an Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Fifthly, <hi>Siricius</hi> accounted Matrimony, pollution. Sixthly, <hi>Vigilius</hi> accurſed all who affirmed, that there be two natures in Chriſt. Seventhly, <hi>Honorius</hi> the firſt, which taught, as <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> confeſſeth, that Chriſt had not two wills or operations. Eighthly,<note place="margin">In Concilio Romano.</note> Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> the ſixth, he aboliſhed all the Acts of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſus</hi> his predeceſſour, and commanded all that had received Orders from him, to be ordered againe: and thought that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament depended upon the vertue of the Miniſter. Ninthly, <hi>in concilio Ravennae habito Iohn</hi> 9. diſanulled all the Acts of <hi>Stephen:</hi> and <hi>Sergius</hi> the third, all that <hi>Formoſus</hi> had done: And ſo that which <hi>Iohn</hi> had done and approved the Acts of <hi>Stephen.</hi> Some of theſe muſt needs erre. Tenthly, <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh, whom Cardinal <hi>Benno</hi> in his writing of him, who lived at the ſame time, makes an Heretick, a Necromancer, a ſeditious, and a Simoniſt, &amp; an adulterer, not the worſt Biſhop, but the worſt of all men. A right <hi>Hellebrand.</hi> Eleventhly, <hi>Celeſtinus</hi> the third allowed hereſie to breake the bond of marriage, and that a man might marry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine if his wife fell into hereſie, and <hi>è contra.</hi> So <hi>Alphonſus de Caſtro.</hi> Twelfthly, <hi>Iohn</hi> 22. or 21. who held that the ſoules ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the bodies, ſaw not God, nor rejoyced not with him, before the day of judgement, and was forced to recant it with ſound of trumpet by the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> for feare of loſing his Popedome, as <hi>Iohn Gerſon</hi> writeth in his Sermon of Eaſter. Thirteenthly, <hi>Iohn</hi> 23. or 22. was accuſed in the Councell of Conſtance for denying eternall life. and the reſurrection of the body.</p>
                        <p>All which, with many moe, prove manifeſtly againſt them, that the Pope can erre, and hath erred, and ſo may ſtill. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> I confeſſe, hath a great many of ſhifts and evaſions to cleare his holy Fathers, but they are ſo light and fooliſh, they are not worth the ſtudying on for the moſt part.</p>
                        <p>This teacheth us how dangerous a thing ignorance is, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> even in every Chriſtian: for if it be the cauſe of errour in the Miniſters, it will be in the people. And if the Miniſters all, one and other, are ſubject to errour, if they erre, and the people be without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, they will go after, taking errour for truth; becauſe they are
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:151759:165"/>able to diſtinguiſh neither the one nor the other. If it were infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible and certaine, that their guides could not erre, nor their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters be deceived, it were no matter though they were never ſo ignorant; but when it is moſt certaine that they are ſubject to it, and their erring will not excuſe the people, though the other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for their abuſing and miſ-leading of them; their ignorance is very dangerous, and that implicite faith (Popery ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends) damnable. And in them and others, who would perſwade the people they may be ignorant, and a little or no knowledge is required of them, it is ſuſpitious, as if they meant to make a prey of them, &amp; to broach ſome errors among them: For then (ſaith <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi>) theeves go to ſtealing when they have firſt put out the candle; and then do men utter their bad wares, when they have dim and falſe lights.</p>
                        <p>To perſwade all men to labour for knowledge, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> and to increaſe in the knowledge of the Word and Myſteries of ſalvation. That they having the rule of truth and falſhood, the word of God may not be carried away with the errour of one or many, be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great or learned. Erre they may, be they never ſo lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: for they know but at the beſt in part, and erre of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes they do, becauſe they are not wholly ſanctified. For as the greateſt part of a Church is wholly unſanctified: ſo the beſt are but in part ſanctified, and ſo are ſubject to partiality and errour; yea, may both erre, and defend errour againſt their knowledge, ſome violent temptation of pride, pleaſure, and profit, and ſuch like, carrying them thereunto, ſeeing none now is inceſſantly gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and governed by the Spirit. Then had they need of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that they may try and diſcerne the ſpirits and doctrines, and he that is not careleſſe which end goes forwards, not retchleſſe for his ſoule whether it walke in the paths of truth, or in the paths of errour, will not be careleſſe for it, and to grow in knowledge. But if they erre, how not we? Lookers on may ſee more then players. We may allude to that, Prov. 28.11. <hi>The rich man is wiſe in his owne conceit: but the poore that hath underſtanding can try him.</hi> And God, often to the ſimple, reveales things, when hid from wiſe, Matth. 11.25. to humble them, and know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves but men.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:151759:166"/>as turbulent and ſeditious perſons, enemies to the common peace of the Chriſtian world. To ſay nothing of the times of Chriſt, and after him of the firſt Churches in the Acts. This was the ſtate of the Chriſtian world in the time of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> when in the Councell of Seleucia and Ariminium, the Nicence faith was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and all the Biſhops of the whole world were carried from the ſoundneſſe of the faith, ſave <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and ſome few Confeſſors baniſhed with him.

And as it was in the times before, often a ſucceſſion of the one without the other. And this is firſt manifeſt by the former doctrine: for when it often happened, that all the ordinary Prieſts, ſuch as had the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſucceſſion, were in errour; God exciting extraordinary Prophets to reprove them, as <hi>Iſaiah, Ieremie,</hi> &amp;c. It muſt needs be that there was a ſeparation of theſe two. In particular, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the time of <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 King. 19.14. So when wicked <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haz</hi> was King, 2 King. 16.11. <hi>Vriah</hi> the high Prieſt corrupting the worſhip. In the Church of the Jewes in Chriſts time it was ſo: for they condemning Chriſt and his followers as ſchiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, Joh. 9.22. and 12.42. This is further proved, Acts 20.29.30. Theſe had their ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles, and held the ſame ſeats, the ſame places which the Apoſtles held, yet had ſnot the ſame truth and faith. So out of the Eccleſiaſticall ſtories it is manifeſt, that the Arrian Biſhops, as <hi>Euſebius Nicomedienſ.</hi> and <hi>Euſtathius,</hi> and others did derive their ſucceſſion of place, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſeats and Churches, from the Apoſtles. For they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, choſen, and ordained, after the cuſtome of the Church, and had no new, but the lawfull calling. So of the Donatiſts, and <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus</hi> in the Church of Antioch ſucceeded <hi>Peter,</hi> as well as they did at Rome. And the Greeke Church, judged by the Papiſts, ſchiſmaticall, hath her perſonall ſucceſſion not onely 1200. yeares, as they confeſſe, from <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, but long before, from <hi>Andreas</hi> the Apoſtle, as <hi>Nicephorus lib.</hi> 8. <hi>Chronol. cap.</hi> 6.</p>

Beſides, it is not certaine nor expreſſed in the word of God, that the Pope was <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor, no not in place, but to be proved onely by tradition, and not to be deduced out of the Word, as <hi>Bellarmine de Rom.

And ſo the maine point, whereon the government and Hierarchy of the Papacie depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, hath no word in the Scriptures to prove it: and ſo the whole is hanged upon the conjectures of men, as upon a rotten threed. For the Scripture not affirming it, what aſſurance can there be for matter of faith, the matter muſt needs be ſuſpitious and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? Againe, even the hiſtories, which is their proofe, are in ſuch various opinions, that a man can hardly tell whom to follow, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>Peters</hi> comming to Rome, and his immediate ſucceſſors. Some ſay he came to Rome in the firſt yeare of <hi>Claudius</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, ſome in the ſecond, ſome in the fourth, ſome in the tenth, and it may be that none of theſe is true: ſure it is, all cannot be true: For his ſucceſſors, <hi>Tertullian</hi> maketh <hi>Clement</hi> his next ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor. <hi>Optatus</hi> nameth <hi>Linus,</hi> and then <hi>Clement.

For what ſucceſſion ſoever, be it never ſo long or glorious (as a greater could not be then theſe Prieſts and people could have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected unto the Prophet) yet if it be without truth of doctrine, and true faith, which is the very ſoule of ſucceſſion, it is nothing elſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:151759:167"/>but a very dead carkaſſe; whereas true faith, without any ſuch outward ſucceſſion, eſtabliſheth and maketh a Church. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed one of the pureſt and moſt excellenteſt Churches was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a ſucceſſion. For the Church, of which Chriſt in his owne perſon was Authour and Maſter, in which the Apoſtle was brought up &amp; inſtructed, had no ſucceſſion. And yet none will, or dare deny, that it was the beſt and pureſt Church. For whom ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Chriſt and his Apoſtles?

And on the contrary, there may be ſucceſſion and no true Church, when the faith is corrupt, and not ſound, which made the Fathers when they ſpeake of ſucceſſion, not urge a naked and externall ſucceſſion, but a true ſucceſſion, and ſuch as was joyned with the ſucceſſion of faith and religion.<note n="*" place="margin">Non ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum filii ſunt, qui te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent loca ſanctorum, ſed qui ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercent opera eorum. <hi>S.

Your Court uſually receiveth good men, but maketh few good, there the wicked are not made better, but the good farre worſe.</p>
                        <p>This teacheth us, <label type="milestone">

So this verily is the high way to have the hatred and contempt of the people, if this be true here ſet downe of God. Yet they will not be perſwaded of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they finde thoſe that will ſpeake faire to their faces, and commend them, and happily countenance them for a while, and ſee not how wicked they are in the eyes of all good men.

Nor as men who promiſe raſhly that they cannot ſpare, and after repent themſelves; none of theſe, nor the like in God, are the cauſe of it, but it is in man himſelfe: for he hath ſtript himſelfe of all intereſt and right unto the promiſes of God; becauſe he hath firſt forſaken him, and dealt unfaithfully with him. Many a man in want of his things he had thought he had had a promiſe for, and being impatient through his corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is like a ſicke man of a feaver, accuſing his meat rather then his palate: ſo he will accuſe God rather then himſelfe.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:151759:170"/>though he did once make a covenant with him; yet he is not the man, becauſe he hath not performed his condition. Like Iſrael, Iſai. 59.1.2. <hi>Behold, the Lords hand is not ſhortned, that it cannot ſave: neither his care heavie that he cannot hear: But your iniquities have ſeparated between you and your God; and your ſins have hid his face from you, that he will not heare.</hi>

                           <hi>HAve we not all one father?</hi>] The ſecond part of the Chapter beginneth here and continueth to the end, containing the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:151759:172"/>reproofe of divers particular vices in the people of Iſrael in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, both Prieſt and people, in this tenth verſe he reproveth their injurious and unequall dealing in the generall.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Have we not all one father?</hi>] Some underſtand theſe words with the next verſe, as if it were a reaſon ſpoken in the defence of their taking of Idolatrous wives, by them who had done it; their reaſon is thus: That ſeeing that they had all one father, which was <hi>Adam,</hi> and all one Creator, which was God: there was no reaſon why they ſhould not marry with them. But others doe underſtand them as two main reaſons againſt their marrying them, urged by the Prophet from God himſelfe: and ſo the expounding of the words will rather confirme, and the greater conſent of the learned old and new, goe that way. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith that the people being returned out of captivity, the Princes and Prieſts, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple put away their wives of the Iſraelites kindred, which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their poverty, and injury of the long way, and weakeneſſe of their ſexe, impatiently bearing the labour, were waſted, and became both infirme and deformed in body; whereupon they matched with ſtrangers, who were freſh in yeares, beautifull and comely, the daughters of rich and mighty men; as we may ſee in the ninth of <hi>Ezra,</hi> that is with the Canaanites, Hethites, Phere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, Jebuſites, Ammonites, &amp;c. Therefore they thinke the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet here reproves them; firſt for their marriages, and after for their divorces, Verſe 16.</p>
                        <p>There are two ſpeciall and chiefe cauſes of love and good will amongſt men; the one is kindred, affinity, or conſanguinity; the other is one and the ſame ſociety of religion. Firſt, nature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells men to affect and love earneſtly thoſe who are borne in the ſame family, deſcended from the ſame parents and ſtocke; which bond cannot be violated or broken off without great wickedneſſe. Secondly, men reaſonable and wiſe, do thinke thoſe ſpecially to be affected by them, who are companions with them in the ſame religion and worſhip. And though this is the moſt worthy and ſure, yet the other goes before, and firſt carries ſway with men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is by nature bred with them, and continued from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie. And theſe two they are here preſſed withall, as thoſe which condemnes their fact, dealing thus to put away the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Iſrael, the worſhippers of the true God, and to take unto them the daughters of the heathen, worſhippers of the falſe Gods. For the firſt of theſe reaſons, it is here ſaid, <hi>Have we not all one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> That is, are we not all men and women deſcended from <hi>Abraham</hi> by one <hi>Iſaac,</hi> from <hi>Iſaac</hi> by one <hi>Iacob?</hi> Why then ſhould we thus doe? diſmiſſe thoſe, or paſſe them over, and joyne our ſelves to the kindred of the heathen and ſtrangers? And for the ſecond he ſaith, <hi>Hath not one God made us?</hi> Do we not all acknowledge one God the Creator, and worſhip and ſerve him
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:151759:173"/>with dutie? Do you diſmiſſe thoſe wives, who acknowledge the ſame Creator with you, and worſhip him, and take unto you thoſe who worſhip Idols for him, and put their truſt in them? To create, or the Creator, is not here taken in that common ſenſe, as when we ſpeake of Gods creation of the world: for then could this be no reaſon againſt, but rather for them, as ſome would make it a reaſon in that ſort which the Prophet laboureth to confute. But this being againſt them, muſt not be taken in that ſenſe, but in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe, as there is a ſpeciall uſe of it in the Scripture, when it ſpeaketh and dealeth of ſome new &amp; ſecret diſpoſition of things, as Jer. 31.22. And ſo it is uſed, Iſaiah 65.18. of ſuch a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall creation is it here meant, where love and dutie is ſpecially due unto thoſe, who are of the ſame religion with us, who follow the lawes and ſtatutes of the ſame Creator and Author.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Why do we tranſgreſſe every one againſt his brother?</hi>] It is taken by ſome to be the reproofe of their vice, though cloſely, or not ſo openly, as verſ. 11. it is ſet downe: i. ſeeing we are of one kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, deſcended from one father, why do we thus tranſgreſſe one againſt another, either putting away, or refuſing our owne kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in reſpect of ſtrangers and aliens? <hi>Brother,</hi> here ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret either the ſiſter or daughter of our brother; or rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the uſe of the Scripture and Hebrew, which by bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther underſtand the female as well as the Male. And the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to the occaſion either both, or but the one: Both, as Jam. 1.2. and the one, as here upon this occaſion, muſt needs be the female.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And breake the covenant of our Fathers.</hi>] Some thinks that this is applied unto the ſecond reaſon; becauſe the covenant of the Fathers was, That they all, and their whole poſterity, ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and worſhip one God onely: and one people ſhould be conſecrated to one and the ſame God. Others thinke, by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is meant the Law of God, a thing uſuall in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that Law which God gave unto our Fathers, that they ſhould not take the daughters of a ſtrange God to wife, or of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nation.</p>
                        <p>Others thinke the reaſon ſtands thus; making a third reaſon of it; becauſe God, when he made covenant with the Iſraelites, did it not with thoſe more then with theſe, with one more then with another, but with all alike: ſo that they who deſpiſe others, violate the common covenant, as if it were onely a covenant made with them.</p>
                        <p>The concluſion of all is thus framed: If you be all one in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule, and by Law, why do you contemne one another?</p>
                        <p>Generally, in that he uſed reaſon, and not the bare authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of God, which had been that hee well might, wee obſerve this:</p>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:151759:173"/>
                        <p>Men who perſwade others to good, or diſſwade them from evill, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine </seg>1</label> muſt uſe all thoſe reaſons that may any way cauſe it to take hold, and put an edge to it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Have we not all one Father?</hi>] But in this verſe, as I ſaid, I take not to be reproved any particular ſinne, but generally their inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and dealing unequally and unjuſtly one with another. And this the firſt reaſon by which it is reproved, condemning this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was againſt nature, they being all of one parent, all one fleſh.</p>
                        <p>Nature it ſelfe, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine </seg>2</label> and humanity, though men have no other bonds to linke them together, ought to keepe men from hurting and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring, or tranſgreſſing one againſt another; and to binde them to be helpfull and profitable, and doe good one to another. So rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth the Prophet heere. And to this I apply that which is Levit. 18. When it is given ſo often a reaſon to diſſwade from injuring, as verſ. 7. for ſhe is thy mother, for it is thy fathers ſhame; 10. thy ſhame, 12. ſhe is thy fathers kinſewoman, 13. mothers kinſwoman. To this may that be uſed, Acts 7.26. Hereto that, Gen. 50.16.17. and Iſai. 58.7.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe unreaſonable creatures, as beaſts and birds, <label type="milestone">

Hence is deemed the reaſon why thoſe beaſts that feed on fleſh, will not eate the fleſh of their owne kinde; taught, as it were, by nature, leſt they ſhould eare and devoure their owne brood, or breeders: how much more then unreaſonable men?</p>
                        <p>Becauſe it is the rule and voice of Nature: <label type="milestone">

                        <p>To condemne men, not onely as irreligious, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> and voyd of pietie and godlineſſe; but as beaſtly and unnaturall men, and voyd of humanity, who injure and wrong, tranſgreſſe againſt others, and oppreſſe them. I meane not ſuch as may ſometimes doe it, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by paſſion or affection, in ignorance and want of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but I ſpeak of ſuch as live in it, and to ſatisfie their owne luſt and deſires, care not whom they wrong &amp; injure; they will deſpiſe, defraud, deceive and oppreſſe any, in buying and ſelling, in letting or ſetting, by manifeſt uſury and other oppreſſion. All is fiſh that comes to net with them: of ſuch I ſpeake, and how rich ſoever they may grow or be, whatſoever otherwiſe, yet are they unnaturall men, and void of humanity. And may reprove them as the Apoſtle the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 11.14. So, doth not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teach, that if any man injure others, it is a ſinne unto him? it is againſt the very light of nature. And though there were no word of God, neither Law nor Prophets, nothing that might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them in the mouth of the Miniſter, which they now ſpurne againſt, and could be content there were none, that they might
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:151759:174"/>ſinne without controulment, yet ſhould they not without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: for even that, Rom. 2.12. will here have place, and ſhall condemne them by the very light of nature, and now double condemne them; becauſe the light of the Word hath ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a darke place, and they have loved darkneſſe more then light.</p>
                        <p>To teach every man, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> that if there were nothing elſe to binde him to do good to others, or avoyd the hurting of others; yet na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ought, and he ought to be thus a law to himſelfe, though he had no written Word from God. Whether he be a husband, or parent, or maſter, or <hi>è contra,</hi> or a private man, nature and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ought to keep him from the one, and hold him to the other.<note n="*" place="margin">Omnia a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimalia na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalibus munimentis providentia coeleſtis armavit.

                           </note> The heavenly providence hath armed all beaſts with naturall defences; but man in ſtead of them hath the affection of pitty, which is called humanity, by which we are defended. This very thing ought then to bind men.</p>
                        <p>It is hard from many men when they reprove others for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing and injuring others: It is not for your profeſſion, it doth not become a man of that zeale and profeſſion as you doe. If they ſpeake it that they are more bound, it is true; but if to excuſe themſelves, or others, as if it were little or no ſinne in them, then it is their corruption, and is falſe: For wherein doth their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion binde them, which nature it ſelfe and humanitie bindes them not to do, or from doing? Undoubtedly in nothing, though it binde more: he is as well bound, that is bound in a ſingle bond, as he who is tied in a double; both are bound, though not alike. Set then religion aſide, which followes in the next place, and even nature it ſelfe binds every man to theſe duties, and from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. and whilſt nature laſteth, and is undiſſolved, the bond is never cancelled. Therefore muſt every one remember it to doe good, and not hurt, even all the dayes of his life, to thoſe to whom nature hath bound him. Contrary to that ſome performe for a while, but as if nature died, they living, do not continue it: as for inſtance, betwixt man and wife, many at firſt doe, but continue not; betwixt parents and children.</p>

                           <hi>Hath not one God made us?</hi>] The ſecond reaſon by which he reproveth their injuring and tranſgreſſing againſt others; becauſe they were all of one Church, profeſſed one religion, and ſerved one God.</p>
                        <p>Religion, <label type="milestone">

And now, we pray thee forgive the treſpaſſe of the ſervants of thy fathers God. And Ioſeph wept when they ſpake unto him.</hi> Manifeſt further; becauſe the foundation of religion, which is the word of God, commands love to neighbours, and ſo under that title, other men, Levit. 19.18. Rom. 13. Tit. 2.11.12. Jam. 1.27. even ſo farre that it comes to enemies, Prov. 25.21. Exod. 25.4. Matth. 5.43.44.</p>

                           </label> and void of all piety and godlineſſe, and yet profeſſe religion, who make no conſcience of hurting their brother, or tranſgreſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, who worſhip the ſame God with them. There are ſome who make no conſcience of tranſgreſſing againnſt their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, by falſe ſlanders, railing ſpeeches, and perſecuting their brethren, as <hi>Iſmael</hi> did <hi>Iſaac,</hi> by mockings and reproaches, yea ſometimes more then the ſervants of a ſtrange God will do; that as an ancient Writer ſaid, As <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> came from the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet hated the ſeed and kindred of <hi>Abraham:</hi> So, he of heretickes, I of Chriſtians, they ſay they profeſſe Chriſt, and yet none ſo much as they, hate the generation of Chriſt his ſeed. May we not ſay of them, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.9. <hi>They ſay, they are Iewes and are not, but are the Synagogue of Satan.</hi> Again, as 1 Cor. 11.18. <hi>When yee come together in the Church, I hear that there are diſſentions among you, and I beleeve it to be true in ſome part:</hi> ſo I heare, that there are ſome who make the profeſſion of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but a cloake, the better to tranſgreſſe againſt their brethren, and under that colour to deceive or injure them; and I beleeve it to be true in ſome part, that ſome doe it that they might better o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-reach or deceive, and plainly injure others. So did <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> the two ſonnes of <hi>Iacob,</hi> to be revenged on the Sheche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, but they had <hi>Iacobs</hi> curſe, and Gods with it: ſo ſhall theſe have ſo croſſing of God, that that which he would have as a main reaſon to tye them together, and keep them from tranſgreſſing one againſt another, they make but a maske for their iniquity. Verily offences muſt come, but woe to that man by whom they come, it were better hee had never been borne. And when Chriſt ſhall come to judgement, howſoever he may carry it out in the mean time, this will not then ſerve, Luke 13.26. and Matth. 7.22. For they ſhall have the anſwer in both places: and if they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded for not helping, Matth. 25. how ſhall they be for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing againſt them, and hurting them?</p>
                        <p>Now that the ſpirit of God by the Prophet hath joyned theſe two, and added religion to nature, as that which ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:151759:175"/>yea makes men performe duties when the other cannot, or is corrupt. From thence I obſerve this inſtruction:</p>

                           </label> is the feare of God, and true religion; no bond of nature is ſtrong enough, if that be wanting, or if it be corrupted and unſound, as it was in this people; but if ſound and true, nothing to that.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Why do we tranſgreſſe every one againſt his brother?</hi>] The word ſignifies to deale diſloyally, traiterouſly, and unfaithfully. And ſo he accuſeth them of perfidious and unfaithfull dealing one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, that they did not keep their promiſe, word and covenant one with another.</p>

                        <p>This will confute a point of Popery whereby they allow things to be done, <label type="milestone">

And this muſt make it good, contrary to the apparent word of God here, and that Rom. 3.8. ſo contrary is the ſpirit of Antichriſt to Chriſts ſpirit.</p>
                        <p>To convince amongſt our ſelves men who allow and maintaine many ſins, becauſe they are profitable to others, &amp; not hurtfull to them; and therefore they think they may be done though they be contrary to the law. One or two inſtances. Many hold an offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lye lawfull, becauſe it may ſtand with charity, when it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for their neighbour. But if againſt the law and word of God which forbiddeth lyes, how ſhould it not be ſinne and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to be done? beſides they muſt underſtand that charity, which is the ſumme of the law, hath reference towards God, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our neighbour, &amp; towards our ſelves. And ſo is this againſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:151759:176"/>charity, though helpfull to thy neighbour, in whoſe favour it is told. Firſt, becauſe it is repugnant to verity, and therefore to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: for God, who is Truth, hath forbidden all untruth, as that which is oppoſite to him, and ſo cannot ſtand with the charity and obedience we owe to God. Secondly, it is to the hurt of the teller, becauſe, Pſal. 5.6. <hi>The lying mouth deſtroyeth the ſoule.</hi> So it cannot ſtand with love which a man oweth to himſelfe. Now then, though a man may helpe his brother and neighbour with the loſſe of his goods and hinderance that way, but not neceſſary with the hazard of his life at all times, but never with the hazard of his ſoule, as every lyer ſhall doe. Againe, things muſt firſt be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red whether lawfull or no, whether agreeable to the word, and then whether profitable or hurtfull, that is a ſecond affection of things, and a ſecond conſideration. They cannot be lawfull but they will be profitable, though not in our carnal apprehenſion, nor unlawfull, but unprofitable, though we alwaies ſee it not. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond inſtance is, for the matter of uſury; many allow it if it bee moderate, and if it be not joyned with the hurt but the profit of the borrower. But whereas uſury is ſimply unlawfull and evill, I may anſwer with ſome of the learned; when men make queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of moderate uſury, whether that be lawfull or no,<note place="margin">Chemnitius.</note> they might as well make queſtion, whether moderate adultery, or moderate lying, or moderate theft be lawfull: for as they are things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unlawfull, ſo is this. Again, I anſwer, it is very hurtfull, and againſt charity: for though it be not againſt the profit of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, yet is it againſt publique charity: for uſury is many waies noyſome to the common wealth, as is eaſie to be ſhewed. Again, it is againſt charity and our allegeance to God, who hath forbidden it, denounced his judgements againſt it, made gracious promiſes to them who will do the contrary. Laſtly, it is againſt love we owe to our owne ſoules; for whoſoever putteth out to uſury, or taketh increaſe, he ſhall not live, but dye the death, Ezek. 18.13. But for the benefit of the borrower, if it ſometimes ſo fall out by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, and his paines and hazard, that is no thanke to the lender: for it is without all queſtion, he never intendeth it, though he may ſometimes pretend it, and ſo though it might make it no ſinne in it ſelfe, yet that makes it ſinne to him: for gaine the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower or not, he will have ſecurity for his principall and gaine, and an abſolute covenant, and makes no proviſion for the borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers indemnity, for he will have it, loſe he or gaine he, all is one to him. And ſo it falleth ſometimes out againſt charity, but if not it is ever againſt charity in them. <hi>Calvin,</hi> who is much pretended for the defence of this: and indeed, upon Ezek. 18. ſaith, that a man may in ſome caſes take uſury, and cannot preciſely be condemned for it: yet in the ſame place he ſaith apertly, we muſt alwaies hold it to be a thing ſcarcely poſſible, that he which taketh uſury, ſhould
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:151759:177"/>not wrong his brother. And therefore it were to be wiſhed that the very name of uſury were buryed and utterly blotted out of the memory of men; but howſoever it may be profitable, and as they thinke ſo agreeable to charity; yet it is unjuſt in it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law of juſtice, then the rule holds, Rom. 3.8.</p>
                        <p>To teach men when they have done any thing, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> or when they are about to doe any thing, to examine it whether it be lawfull or good, not by the event and fruit which may follow of it, or hath; but by the law of God how agreeable it is to it, and how profitable it is, or may be, nor how it is fallen out for Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but how lawfull and warrantable by the word: for a man may profit another and gloryfie God by that for which he may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. As in <hi>Iudas</hi> and the Jewes. If then a man hath done any thing and it is fallen out to the profit of man, and to the glory of God; it is never a whit better for him, unleſſe he finde the thing he hath done to be agreeable to the word of God; for if he have done evill and good come of it, it is no thanke to him, but to the providence of God who ſo diſpoſed it. So if a man be about to doe any thing, if not agreeable or repugnant to the word, he muſt not think it good &amp; lawfull for to be done, becauſe he ſees it may profit man or honour God, as if he had need of his lyes and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull actions; neither if he be to doe that which is agreeable, he muſt not thinke he muſt abſtaine and not doe it, onely becauſe he doubts of the conſequent of it, but that is lawfull and which he muſt doe by his place that he ought to doe, and leave the other to God; for not the effects make a thing good, but the ground of it; not the fruit makes a tree good, but the roots of it. A man may ſpoyle a good action agreeable to the word by his corrupt end, affection, or defect of faith; but he can never make it good, by them nor any thing elſe, if it be not with that agreeable.</p>

The ſinne is, that they have married with the daughters of Idolaters: the heynouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of which ſinne is amplified from the perſons, as that it is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:151759:177"/>Judah which hath done this evill, whom he had choſen before all the world; and ſpecially reſerved to himſelfe in the defection of the ten Tribes, they whoſe name is <hi>Faithfull,</hi> is become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull, from whom no ſuch thing was expected, that they ſhould doe ſo, yet they had tranſgreſſed. From the ſubject. In Iſrael among that people, whom the Lord hath enriched and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with ſo many bleſſings and benefites. In Jeruſalem, in the place which he choſe to place his Sanctuary, which was the Kings ſeat, and mother Citie; whence whatſoever comes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pietie and honeſty, or the contagions of vice and iniquity, may and will eaſily ſpread themſelves abroad. For the thing, it is called an abomination; that is, ſuch an evill as the LOrd abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. Abomination generally is taken for any thing that is done againſt law and right, againſt ſome ancient decree, or the cuſtome of lawes and manners. As generally, Gen. 46.34. Hence in Scripture is this word Abomination uſed ſo much, when it ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of mixing of ſeed, when caution is had, left any thing be done but that which is right and lawfull.</p>
                        <p>It is amplified further, becauſe they have <hi>polluted Gods Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>] By holineſſe is here meant that holineſſe which was in this people, becauſe they were dedicated to God, and the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Lord, and his owne proper people, gotten and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed to himſelfe; which holineſſe they had violated, in that they had mixed themſelves with ſtrange women. Thus <hi>Hierom</hi> expounds theſe words, and it is moſt like to be the meaning: for ſo is it taken, Pſal. 114.2 <hi>Iudah was his Sanctuary,</hi> or <hi>holy place:</hi> That land was dedicated to God, and poſſeſſed of God, and by that is made holy; and there he exerciſeth his power by directing and governing them as his owne people, and thoſe who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to him.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>And hath married the daughter of a ſtrange God.</hi>] In the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall it is, <hi>Hath the daughter:</hi> but the meaning is, <hi>Hath married the daughter;</hi> that is, ſuch as profeſſe and worſhip a ſtrange God: not that they were Gods, or thus acknowledged by him, and the Word; but it is an uſuall thing in rhe Scripture, to call things not as they are, or as the Scripture judgeth of them, but after the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of thoſe of whom he ſpeaks, as 2 Cor. 4.4. Phil. 3.19. So theſe were not true Gods, nor no Gods indeed, but ſo accounted of. And this name is communicated to them. <hi>Origen. hom.</hi> 14. <hi>in Numeros,</hi> hath this rule, That whereſoever the name <hi>Iehovah</hi> is, there is meant the true God, the creator of the world; but the

Deut. 20.18. Hence he ſpeaketh of particular ſinnes, as Prov. 11.1. and 12.22. Rev. 2. Hence he is ſaid to abhorre the man that is wicked: not that he doth his perſon, as he is his creature, which he loves, but as hee hath made himſelfe ſuch, Pſal. 5.6.</p>

To theſe we may adde that of Numb. 25.3.4. &amp;c. the cauſe of the great famine, 2 Sam. 21. was the Kings not puniſhing of a ſinne committed by <hi>Sauls</hi> houſe; which done, the famine ended.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>This ſheweth the folly of thoſe men, <label type="milestone">

This folly appeareth, becauſe then the Lord will take them into his owne hands, and that, ſaith the Apoſtle, is a fearfull thing. And more cauſe of feare, as Chriſt ſpeaketh, Matth. 10.28. What will it profit them then to eſcape the one, and fall into the hands of the other? As much as if a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer ſhould by means and money either get his fact paſſed over at the Seſſions, and fall into the hands of the Judges at the Aſſizes; or ſcape their hands, either by corrupting the Judge, or the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe to pack a Jury for his purpoſe, or the fore-man to lead the reſt, when the next of kindred is ready to enter an appeale to the Kings Bench, where there ſhall be no ſuch packing. All he hath got by it, is his repriving for a while, but to his greater ſhame and puniſhment. So with theſe. Many a great man lives in oppreſſing and injuring others his tenants and inferiours, and either there is no civill law againſt him; or if there be, either his greatneſſe or
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:151759:182"/>purſe will carry it out well enough, that no puniſhment ſhall come upon him, or take hold of him: and then hee ſleepeth without feare, when he is as a man that hath eſcaped the rage of a foole, and is fallen into the power of a Bear robbed of her whelps. As Maſters, if they live in oppreſſion, or uſury, or deceit, or drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or adultery, or ſome ſuch like, and can eſcape the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates hands by the meanes they make; feare nothing: That is their folly, there is more cauſe of feare, God will take them into his hand. Many ſervants, when they have injured and dealt deceitfully with their Maſters, ſtealing from them, or ſerving them with eye-ſervice, miſ-ſpending their goods, and not furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, by their endevours, their profites, if they can eſcape their maſters hands by lying or ſhifting, or diſſembling, or by his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence, lenity, or remiſneſſe, they never feare: this is their folly, there is now more cauſe of feare, God will take them into his hand, to cut them off by the plague, or ſome other judgement. Finally, let theſe and all the like, ſee their folly, that thinke there is no feare if they can eſcape the hand and ſword of man by ſuch meanes; yet there will be no eſcaping of the hand of God, who will, as he ſaith, ſend ſerpents that will not be charmed. Jerem. 8.17. O conſider this yee that forget God! as if hee would not judge the earth when men neglect it, leaſt hee teare you in pieces.</p>
                        <p>The cauſe why God ſendeth generall judgements upon ſuch a City or Land as ours is; <label type="milestone">

For if the Juſtices at the Seſſions ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme throughly, and deliver the goale every one to his ſeverall puniſhment, the Judges ſhould have little cauſe to ride circuit, or if they did, but to make ſhort ones. So if Magiſtrates, God would not puniſh, or if he did, yet not ſo long as three yeares famine, and three yeares peſtilence: So that of all the enemies of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth none is ſo great as remiſſe, careleſſe and corrupt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates; for they are a cauſe of Gods generall judgements, when as their ſeverity would prevent. And none ſuch a fore-runner of ſome generall judgement, as they and their remiſneſſe; and in a Magiſtrate, it is better for the generall good, that he be too ſevere puniſhing ſome he ought and might ſpare, then remiſſe paſſing by others that deſerve it.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:151759:184"/>tearme, till the day of hearing come, that a plea they have drawne for them will hold good, and then they confeſſe themſelves to be in an error, when ſentence goes againſt them, and they deprived of their heritage; like unskilfull or unfaithfull Phyſitians, who finding what kinde of phyſicke their patients paſſet doth beſt rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, though it be neither of force to preſerve or recover him; yet to keepe themſelves in requeſt and practice ever preſcribe him that, though he die for it in the end. Such Phyſitians are they of no value. If any man thinke I ſlander them, becauſe they talke much of pennance and confeſſion and ſuch things; I anſwer, I doe not; to inſtance in one: The ſchoole-men teach that ſalvation is in the ſacrament or ſacrifice of the maſſe, as health is in a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, which cures though the party doe nothing to helpe, never beleeve, only receive it. They teach then that theſe reconcile without repentance. I deny not that our latter Papiſts, when they find things written, ſcanned, and ſo prove ſcandalous, they have helped things with their late expoſitions; but it is one thing what they are forced to ſay by argument, another thing what they commonly teach to the people, who have the one taught to them without the other. They deale like ſome Phyſitians, who when they have to deale with common patients, who favour no religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thinke indeed health is in their power, and their medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, they promiſe them ſimply and abſolutely health by them: But when they have patients that know religion, or finde a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with them, who knowes health is not in their power or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; then they tell them they muſt looke to God, and reconcile themſelves to God, and then by his bleſſing they ſhall doe them good. So theſe.</p>

The Church is full of theſe fooles: for how many are there: who if they heare by the Word, or ſee by the ſhaking of the rod, that the Lord is angry, thinke by an offering, giving almes to the poore, by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and bowing themſelves, by a little more frequenting of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or comming to heare the Word, to eſcape well enough though they never repent and forſake their ſinnes? or if God ſmite them, that they are ſicke upon their beds, and draw neere to the buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, if they give ſomewhat largely to hoſpitals, and holy uſes, to Schooles and Churches, though they never truly ſorrow before God, nor ſatisfie the injuries done to men by reſtitution, and ſuch like; yet God will be well pleaſed with them, and they ſhall not be cut off, but enjoy the everlaſting Tabernacles of <hi>Iacob.</hi> But fools &amp; blinde! why ſhould they imagine that ſhould help them, which will not another, neither ever would? Is not he the ſame,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:151759:184"/>and is there not ſtill the ſame meanes to appeaſe him; that which could not then, can it now? If the body be to be cured, if any thing be brought unto them, they enquire who ever uſed it, and what effect it had with them; and if they heare of many who did uſe it, and none ever recovered by it, they will never truſt to it; and yet for the ſoule they will go contrary. But if theſe doe not appeaſe him, why are they commanded, or why is that? Heb. 13.16. <hi>To doe good, and diſtribute, forget not: for with ſuch ſacrifices God is well pleaſed.</hi> I anſwer, they are commanded for other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, as duties and teſtimonies, and ſignes of thankfulneſſe: for it followes not that there is no uſe of them, unleſſe this be; God ordained them for other purpoſes. And as it is in ſalves, they cure that they were ordained for, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi> For the ſalve for the eye cannot cure the cut of the hand. And for that, <hi>Do and live,</hi> that is underſtood of the whole and of perfect doing, which is impoſſible for any, becauſe of their weakneſſe, Rom. 8. And that of the Hebrewes doth not tell us that that doth appeaſe God, when he is angry, but that they pleaſe him after he is appeaſed, and reconciled: for then he accepts them graciouſly and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably. For ſo much riſeth out of Heb. 13.15. <hi>Let us therefore by him offer the ſacrifice of praiſe alwayes to God, that is, the fruit of the lips, confeſſe to his Name.</hi> Where he makes mention of Chriſt, ſhewing that they pleaſe him, comming from faith in Chriſt. But when a man lies in his ſinne, and ſo purpoſeth, and is without faith and without Chriſt, all the ſacrifices of ſuch a wicked man are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination to the Lord; more when they are offered with a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked minde, of deſerving at his hands, and derogating from Chriſt, and making him to juſtifie the wicked.</p>

But in vaine ſhall we truſt unto them, if we remaine in our ſinnes, without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and forſaking of them. In vaine truſts any man to the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion and his ſalves to cure his diſeaſe; all the while there is in the wound, within the fleſh iron remaining. <hi>Auguſt. de rectit.

All the while that <hi>Achan</hi> and his execrable bootie was in the Lords Campe, the teares and prayers of the whole prevailed nothing. Joſhua 7. but he taken out of the way and ſtoned, they prevailed. To prevaile then with God, and to have him reconciled, and to eſcape his diſpleaſure theſe cannot doe it, unleſſe we caſt out the execrable thing. If <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Rulers will hang up the heads of the people before the ſunne, and <hi>Phineas</hi> execute juſtice, the plague
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:151759:185"/>ſhall ceaſe; if every one will doe ſo with his ſinnes, he ſhall not be cut off, or if he die he ſhall live. The Marryners who were in a ſtorme, Jonah 1. tooke the contrary courſe to helpe themſelves, and ſave their lives, by unlading their Ship, and caſting all into the ſea, but it ſerved not the turne, nor helped them till <hi>Ionas</hi> was caſt into the ſea upon whom the lot fell, who had offended; ſo in this: many may give their goods, &amp;c. and yet it will not ſerve; caſt lots, it will light upon thy ſinnes, and if that will not be caſt into the ſea, thinke that there will be no calming of it.</p>
                        <p>Now before we leave this verſe, it may be ſome Papiſts will gather hence as from the like places, that the Church ſtandeth not of the elect and predeſtinate onely, as we affirme, for none elected can be cut off from it, ſpecially if we underſtand the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them off from the everlaſting Tabernacles. Therfore they now condemne this in us as the counſell of <hi>Conſtance</hi> condemned <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> and burnt him. But this, neither any the like place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futeth that we hold, who doe not deny that wicked men and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates may be of particular Churches, but not of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique; of particulars, becauſe to be in a particular Church is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but for a man to joyne himſelfe in that ſociety, which profeſſeth true religion. But to be of the Catholique Church is to be joyned to Chriſt as his member, and to draw life from him; ſo that he doth not, neither can periſh, In a particular Church then may wicked and reprobates be, as bad humours and rotten mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are in the body, but not in the Catholique Church, which is Chriſts body; which as his naturall body could not ſee corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, neither can it have any ſuch corrupts parts, and as no part of it could be cut off, no more of this; for where the head is, there ſhall all the members be, whereas then they ſhall never come where Chriſt is, they cannot be members of him, and ſo no parts of the Catholique Church. But are they not parts of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar? they are; but yet it followes not that every one in them is part of it; for as every ward or ſtreete of London is part of the whole, yet followes it not that every one in them is part of it, for forrainers and ſtrangers may be in it. There is none of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, but he either is or hath beene in ſome viſible and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church; yet it followes not that all that are in it, are of it. And by this may be anſwered all thoſe parables and other places they bring out of the Scriptures to prove that wicked men are of the Catholique Church, for they are all underſtood of particular Churches, where the wicked are mixed inſeparably with the good, as Chaffe is with the Wheate in the field and barne, as Lees with the Wine, in the Terſe and Hogſhead; yet is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Chaffe Wheate, nor the Lees Wine, neither they the Church.</p>

                           <p>And this have ye done againe, and covered the Altar of the Lord with teares, with weeping, and with mourning: becauſe the offering is no more regarded, neither received acceptably at your hands.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>AND this have ye done againe.]</hi> The Prophet proceedeth to a ſecond ſinne in this people and to reprove it, going from their ſtrange wives, to their having of many wives, to multiplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them which is reproved in this verſe and 14. and 15. Of the whole we have two parts: 1. his reproofe, 2. his exhortation to the contrary, <hi>fine v.</hi> 15. In the reproof as the vice is checked, but not ſo openly as the former, yet neceſſarily out of the 15. verſe it followeth, that the grieving of their wives was by taking other wives to them. Now the amplification of this ſinne, or the hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſeneſſe of it, is ſet forth two wayes: Firſt, becauſe it was injurious to their wives and themſelves, verſe 13. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was againſt the inſtitution and ordinance of God, verſe 14.15. Now the firſt againſt their wives, becauſe they grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and vexed them, and againſt themſelves, becauſe they made their own offerings to be rejected of the Lord.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And this have ye done againe.]</hi> And this ſinne have you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited in the ſecond place which comes here to be reproved a mongſt theſe particulars, you have taken not onely ſtrangers but you have joyned them to your lawfull wives and taken them with them, and made them to mourne and weepe</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And covered the Altar of the Lord with teares.]</hi> The Iſraelites women or their owne proper and lawfull wives, finding that they tooke others to them, and finding them in their places where they ought to have beene, and who had onely the right unto them, they wept day and night before the Altar of the Lord, as it were accuſing his providence, that he did not releeve, and redreſſe their injuries.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ye have covered.]</hi> He accuſeth not thoſe who did weepe, but thoſe who were the cauſe of their weeping.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ye have covered.]</hi> That is, you have made your wives by your carriage and dealing towards them to cover. So <hi>Cyrill</hi> interpreteth theſe words; and that both becauſe the place muſt needs have it ſo interpreted, as alſo from a common and uſuall kinde of ſpeech. For when we doe any thing compelled or drawne to it, either by ſome vehement love or hatred, or pitty of any man, or by ſome other affection, he is ſaid to doe it by affection of whom we are compelled or drawn to it. As if a man could not beare the deſire
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:151759:186"/>he hath to his abſent friend, or his dead ſonne; we ſay his ſonne or his friend will not let him reſt or be in quiet; for he is often ſaid to doe, that doth ſo worke, and moveth him either by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell or command or impluſion though by another. That inſtance in this caſe we may give. Zach. 11.13.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Caſt it into the Potters field.]</hi> It is a Propheſie of the money which <hi>Iudas</hi> ſhould take for the betraying of Chriſt, and what he ſhould do with it: And when he was to do it &amp; did caſt it into the Temple. Math. 27.5. It is ſpoken here as if Chriſt did it, or ſhould doe it; not that he perſonally did it, but becauſe he moved <hi>Iudas,</hi> and after a ſort compelled him to doe it.</p>
                        <p>Now the greatneſſe of theſe womens ſorrowes are increaſed or amplified, that they were ſo affected that teares came from them; and if it be thought that it is eaſie for that ſex to ſhed teares yet this comes not from the compoſition, but the extreame griefe they ſuſtained, when they came to ſo many, as it were cover the Altar of God, even that Altar where they ſought for eaſe and comfort. And further to amplifie it, it is ſaid with weeping and mourning; that is, their teares were joyned with ſobs and ſighes, and outcryes, by which the ſorrow and anguiſh of their minde was increaſed, when as God would have his Altar without all ſpot or injury moſt pure, ſacred and conſecrated to him, inſomuch as he forbad the ſtones of it to be wrought or cut with any inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of iron; it muſt needs be ungratefull and unacceptable to him when it was covered and compaſſed with teares, ſighes, and lamentations of thoſe who were in miſery, vexed by their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and their concubines.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Altar of the Lord]</hi> This amplifies further their ſorrow, that they came to the Altar of the Lord to complaine, as being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all hope of helpe from man, and all meanes, and had onely God to flye to and his helpe; for it is a figne of great oppreſſion when as men miſerable and affected with injury, come mourning and lamenting to Gods Altar to complaine to him, as thoſe who have no helpe, no defence in the counſells or helpe of men, none in the Judges and Magiſtrates of the time, againſt ſuch injuries.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Becauſe the offering is no more regarded.]</hi> Or <hi>ſo that your offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.]</hi> It is that which containeth the injury to themſelves, for by theſe tears &amp; lamentations of the wives, the anger of the Lord was ſo ſtirred up againſt them that he ſaith all their ſacrifice &amp; offerings were not accepted or regarded of him. <hi>i.</hi> The tears of your oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed wives are as a vaile upon my Altar, and do all ſo cover it, that your ſacrifices, and oblations cannot be ſeene, or make me not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them when their cryes and their prayers come both before me, they doe ſo trouble and corrupt your prayers and ſo hinder, that they are not heard of me at all.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Ye have done againe.]</hi> In the ſecond place adding this ſinne to the former, a greater to the leſſe. Some who were ſingle tooke ſtrange wives, and when others ſaw that was borne withall, and the magiſtrates did not controule and puniſh it, they proceed to this, that having wives of the daughters of God, they tooke to them the daughters of a ſtrange God.</p>
                        <p>Corruptions ſuffered in the whole Church and particular members, and not reproved, puniſhed and corrected, <label type="milestone">

                           <hi>And covered the Altar of the Lord with teares.]</hi> The firſt reaſon condemning this poligamy is drawne from the grief of the wives, and it ſtands thus: That which is a griefe to the wife, and fills her heart with forrow and anguiſh, even then when ſhee comes to Gods Altar, Gods ſervice ought not to be done by the husband, but ſuch is this.</p>
                        <p>The husband ought not to doe that which will grieve and vex his wife, and make her unfit for duties to himſelfe, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                           </label> and ſervice to God. It is here the force of the Prophets reaſon. And this is the commandement of the Apoſtle. 1 Pet. 3.7. Collo. 3.19. This <hi>Laban</hi> ſaw by the light of name, which made him take an oath of <hi>Iaakob</hi> Gen. 31.50. <hi>If thou ſhall vex my daughters, or ſhal take wives beſide my daughters; there is no man with us, behold God is witneſſe betweene thee and me.</hi> This made <hi>Rebekah</hi> ſo urge <hi>Iſaac</hi> for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting of <hi>Iaakob.</hi> Gen. 27.46.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe a man muſt not do that which may grieve or offend a weake brother, to drive him backe, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> or make him leſſe fit and chearefull in the fervice of God, and following of him, much leſſe a wife.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe ſhe is the weaker veſſell, 1 Pet. 3.7. <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> The weakeneſſe of the ſex craves more indulgence and care. As we more eaſily pardon children if they offend in any thing, by reaſon of the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of their years, and ignorance of it. So the infirmity of their ſex ought to make men, they be not rough and ſevere with them. Some tranſlate it Inſtrument: And as <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeakes of it, as a Knife with a tender edge, men will not cut ſtones, braſſe, or iron with it.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe ſhe is partaker of the ſame and manifold graces of life, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> (as ſome books have it) 1 Pet. 3.7. Seeing God hath made her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker with him of baptiſme, and of thoſe things that are had by Chriſt, and made her heire of Heaven with him: God having thus equalled her, it ſhold reſtrain him off from grieving her: for if we reſpect the inward man, and as every one is in Chriſt, all are equall, and there is no difference betweene man and wife; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath ſo ordained things, he muſt be head and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne, and ſhe muſt be ſubject, and be governed; yet in his
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:151759:187"/>governement and ſuperiority becauſe God hath thus honoured her, he muſt not be grievous to her.</p>
                        <p>To reprove all ſuch husbands as make no care at all of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and vexing their wives, <label type="milestone">

And of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ſuch as are ready to cry out of an offence, or an occaſion of grief which a man is forced to give to his brother; yet they care not to grieve their owne fleſh in a neerer conjunction. By their abſence they grieve them, ſeldome at home with them, but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king more delight in riotous and diſſolute company, more in Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernes and Ordinaries where there are lewd and veine exerciſes, then in the ſociety of their loving and kinde wife, making her ſit ſighing and ſobbing at home, mingling her meate with teares, and her prayers, if ſhe ſavour religion, with mourning and weeping; or elſe which falls out with too many for want of their husbands co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany they fall into the ſnares of Satan, &amp; have inſtruments ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting to them that their husbands do not love them; by which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a woman that otherwiſe would be honeſt falls into folly and uncleaneneſſe, which the husbands care &amp; loving company would have prevented, which commeth at the length to the ruine of them and their houſes. If they tell me they muſt goe abroad and have their pleaſure and ſports; I tell them that their neceſſary go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad I reſtraine not, but their unneceſſary: And if they muſt, why may not the wife ſay ſo too? but I will not be comely to excuſe her wandring, neither will it be born with, &amp; there is no reaſon it ſhould, for they looke ſhe ſhould accept their company and be willing to be with them, and reaſon good. And why then ſhould not they be as willing to dwell with them? and to give them comfort and content, and not to vex them by their unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary abſence; which becauſe they were ſo apt to doe by name they are commanded to dwell with them, 1 Pet. 3.7. but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man onely by implication and conſequent; but ſome bide alwaies at home, but better for their wives they were abſent; they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver content with any thing they do, but diſgrace them before their ſervants and company, and be bitter unto them in word &amp; deed, and provoke them to unkindneſſe &amp; diſtemper; by ſtrange cariage of theirs, it may be ſometimes taking <hi>Sarahs</hi> may de, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, though <hi>Sarah</hi> never give her him, and ſo driving them into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers paſſions &amp; diſtractions; making them forget both their ſex &amp; their duty; and hence comes oftentimes ſo many complaints of wives when the husband is the cauſe of it. As if the head ſhould lead the body through fire &amp; water, through myre &amp; dirt, through woods and thickets, where it receives much hurt, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the hurt and paine that it ſuffereth; ſo many by their ſtrange behaviour draw themſelves into contempt and make their wives undutifull, and then exclaim againſt them when they ſhould
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:151759:187"/>condemne themſelves, they have gone againſt the rule of God, and ſo have brought the curſe of God upon them.</p>
                        <p>To inſtruct every man to abſtaine from vexing and grieving his wife, either by his abſence or preſence, but to dwell with her, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> and delight in her company; not withdrawing himſelfe from her, but upon a good calling, and a good cauſe: and then ſo as ſhe may perceive he takes no delight, nay, that it is a griefe to him to be an occaſion of her griefe, and that yet he leaves his heart behinde with her. When he is preſent, he muſt live lovingly and amiably with her, abſtaining from all things that may grieve her: ſo ſhall he give her an example to do ſo to him. For they ought not to pleaſe themſelves, but one another. The good things that are in her, he muſt cheriſh: for as in children or ſervants, ſo in the wife: nothing incourageth her more in any good thing, then that her husband obſerveth and approveth thoſe good things are in her. The evill things, ordinary infirmities, he muſt rather intreat God for them, then reprove her; but if either, he muſt take his fitteſt time for it: as with Phyſitians, obſerve her nature, as they their patients, and do it in love, not paſſion, with a grave, yet cheerfull countenance, letting her ſee her fault out of the Word, rather then from his will and diſlike. And though he be maſter Bee, and have a ſting, yet muſt he ſeldome or never uſe it, unleſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity drive him, and that by her peeviſhneſſe rather then his paſſion or folly in handling of the matter. And ſo may he have comfort by her, and fruit of her: for ſhee is therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a vine, which by the care and diligence of the Gardiner in carefull pruning and underpropping it, and dreſſing of it, brings forth fruit, even grapes, whence comes wine, which rejoyceth the heart: otherwiſe it will but wallow on the ground, and remaine fruitleſſe. But to conclude, provided alwayes that ſhe be dutifull and kinde, loving and obedient unto him; or elſe ſhe forfeits her right: and then if he be bitter and unkinde to her, I do not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant him, but I leſſe blame him. If ſhe be to him not a turtle Dove, but a chattering Pye, full of brawlings and contentions, becauſe every thing muſt not be as ſhe would have it; I leſſe blame him if he delight abroad, ſeeing <hi>Salomon</hi> hath ſaid, Prov. 21.9. <hi>It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, then with a contentious wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in a wide houſe.</hi> Prov. 19.13. <hi>The contentions of a wife are as a continuall dropping.</hi> If ſhe be, as one ſaith, like a vine that were planted in the flowing ſea, which proſpereth leaſt when the water is loweſt: ſo his fellowſhip ſweeteſt when he is furtheſt off. If as many women, who tell us they make themſelves fine and trim to pleaſe their husbands, and yet are leaſt trim when they onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them, but onely when they are to ſhew themſelves abroad, which in many, is rather to pleaſe others then their husbands; (I cenſure not all) ſo they have no cheerfulneſſe and loving carriage
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:151759:188"/>in them when they and their husbands are alone, never ſo merry as when he is abſent, never ſo ſolemne and drooping as with him, as if his company were a burden, and his preſence a clog unto them; who can to any body elſe, put on cheerfull lookes, have lively ſpirits, and finde talke enough; but with their husbands can finde none, but ſit heavie a whole dinner and ſupper while, and not a word from her, no token of her joying in his company. And upon every diſcontent, be ſtrange a day, two or three, looking he ſhould ſeeke to her. I ſay, by ſuch dealings ſhe hath forfeited her right; and though it bee <hi>Summum jus,</hi> and ſo <hi>ſumma iujuria,</hi> to take it, ſuch a forfeiture, or rather it is indeed injuſtice, yet if het do take it, it is but juſt upon her; and though he be not fit to do it, yet ſhe hath deſerved to ſuffer it.</p>

And the injury which is done to others, hurts none but thoſe who do it, ſo thoſe who ſuffer do not repay, or be brought to ſinne. For example; what was more unhappy then <hi>Cain?</hi> The death he brought upon <hi>Abel</hi> hath made him that ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, to be accounted juſt in all ages; and him that did it, a parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide and murtherer.

And if men be not brought to commit ſinne, and this in particular, what hurt have they by it? It is another truth, that there is no man hurt but of himſelfe: for admit a man have his goods taken from him,<note place="margin">Nemo ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, niſi aſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſo. <hi>Chryſ.</hi>

Example <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi> Theſe and the like ſhould perſwade us to patience, and not to reſiſt. And why ſhould ſuch things be hard? If I let him alone, he will be worſe. Haſt thou more care of him then of thy ſelfe? But are not theſe words of corruption and pride, who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh things againſt God? Admit he be hurt, yet God ought to be obeyed.

The ſinne is that which is againſt the ordinance and inſtitution of God, that ought not to be done; ſuch is this. Now it is againſt his inſtitution, becauſe it is againſt that covenant, whereof hee is both Author and witneſſe. The way of ſetting down this is, by way of queſtion and anſwer, from the people, &amp; to them from God, depending upon the former. The Lord had told them it made their prayers to be rejected. They aske why it ſhould be ſo? yet ye ſay wherin, or wherfore, for what cauſe, or what reaſon there was why their offerings ſhould be rejected, and why he would not receive their prayers? As men that would not acknowledge that there was any ſin or fault in them, but put him to his proofe how he would make it good, and ſhew them where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they had offended, not willing to confeſſe unleſſe he can wreſt it from them.</p>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:151759:190"/>as witneſſe when he bound himſelfe to take her for his onely wife. So that witneſſe betweene thee and thy wife is witneſſe of that Covenant that is paſſed betwixt thee and thy wife, and which he ordained. <hi>Who is the wife of thy youth]</hi> One whom thou haſt had from thy youth, who hath beene long delightfull, comfortable, and amiable unto thee by her beauty, helpes, and chearefulneſſe, and other fruits of her youth and of marriage, when thou being in thy youth, married her a young Virgine. And ſo it is no new rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor yet any ſtrange and obſcure name of your duty mutually to be performed, that it may be accounted either a ſmall thing, or is to be denyed and lightly regarded, but it is moſt ancient and of long continuance, even from your youth; neither is there any thing committed by her why thou ſhouldeſt violate thy faith and breake thy covenant with her, for ſo that, <hi>againſt whom thou haſt tranſgreſſed.]</hi> Is to be read, with whom thou haſt dealt unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, breaking thy covenant.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe words, <hi>hath beene witneſſe.]</hi> Some underſtand as if it were meant, that he were witneſſe of the injuries and indignities done againſt them. And that howſoever ſome would leſſen things, yet the Lord tooke notice of them, as great injuries: yet this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the very tenor of the words will not carry it, for it is not he is witneſſe of, you have been unfaithfull to them, but between thee &amp; her; with whom thou haſt dealt unfaithfully. Others would have it; <hi>he is witneſſe:</hi> That is, he hath conteſted betwixt thee and her; that is, hath commanded how thou ſhouldſt carry thy ſelfe towards thy wife, when he ſaid, Gen. 2.24. Therefore ſhall man leave his father and his mother, and ſhall cleave to his wife, and they ſhall be one fleſh. But though ſome of the learned, as <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Cyril</hi> incline to this, it ſeemeth to me ſomewhat violent.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Yet is ſhe thy companion.]</hi> This is added to amplifie the crime of unfaithfulneſſe, becauſe ſhe was united to him in nighneſſe of blood, being fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone, and in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of life admitted to a partaking of his government and goods, or companion of his bed and government, and that by a covenant made betwixt them, whereunto he had bound himſelfe: <hi>Yet is ſhe,</hi> ſaith the Prophet; that is, for all that ſhe is thus, thou haſt dealt thus and ſo with her.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:151759:190"/>which is of the husband to her, muſt be underſtood of the wives to him. So the Prophet here condemnes the mans perfidiouſneſſe as a ſin to God. And as much <hi>Solomon</hi> inſinuates for the woman, Prov. 2.17. <hi>Which forſaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the Covenant of her God</hi> That a leud woman dealing unfaithfully with her husband, ſinned againſt God, in breaking the Covenant whereof he was Authour. This is further proved becauſe their naturall duties are commanded of God, as Epheſ. 5.22.25. Collo. 3.18.19. and other places.</p>

The duties of the husband conditioned at the Covenant were to love his wife, to be faithfull to her in his body and goods, to dwell with her, to governe her, to inſtruct her, be an example to her, give her due benevolence of maintenance and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and ſuch like. And of the wife to love and be faithfull to him, to feare and obey him. In any one of theſe to faile, is to tranſgreſſe againſt the Lord. And though ſometimes in their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption they could conſent to tranſgreſſe one againſt the other; as the husband that his wife ſhould be a harlot, and proſtrate her for gaine to another, or that he might without her reproofe be an adulterer and <hi>è contra:</hi> And ſo it may ſeeme to be no injury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that, that <hi>volenti non ſit injuria:</hi> yet is it a ſinne, againſt God, and that which may procure the curſe of God upon them, to the ruine and deſtruction of the whole family together with
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:151759:191"/>them. It is uſuall with men, that they are carefull not to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe one againſt another in thoſe things eſpecially which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law of the Prince; therein they will refrain themſelves, that they treſpaſſe not, though they take ſome liberty in leſſer things.

It was a weighty ſpeech, ſpoken gravely, of old <hi>Eli</hi> to his ſonnes, if they had had grace to have thought of it, 1 Sam. 2.25. <hi>If one man ſinne againſt another, the Iudge ſhall judge him; but if a man ſinne againſt the Lord, who ſhall intreat for him?</hi> which may be applied to this.</p>

A thing either unknown or neglected of moſt, as if there were no ſinne in it, or but onely offence againſt themſelves, as if God never regarded what they did, or as if never their faithfull carriage one to another pleaſed him, nor tranſgreſſing diſpleaſed him. Hence it is uſuall, that when the wife hath been diſobedient to her husband, diſdainfull and deſpiſing them, becauſe they happily have more knowledge or graces then they, which ſometimes falls out, though unfitly; and the huſband bitter and rough, and unkinde to her, if they drinke one to another, or uſe ſome other ceremony to make reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God is never thought of, as if he were not offended, and that they ought not to humble themſelves to him. And hence it is, that this dayes falling out, or injuring, is puniſhed with the next; God puniſhing one ſinne with another. And whereas the man tranſgreſſed againſt her to day, ſhe tranſgreſſed againſt him to morrow; and ſo they live ſtill in ſinne and offences, whereas if they had truly humbled themſelves to God, they might both have the pardon of that, and obtaine the powring out of graces upon them, by which they might not afterwards tranſgreſſe one againſt another: But for want of this, comes the mutuall and daily offences betwixt them, and oftentimes Gods hand purſues the ſurviver: As an unkinde man hath his recompence by a ſecond wife, which payes him home his ſinnes againſt his former. And an undutifull woman by a ſecond husband, which made the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:151759:191"/>Fathers, <hi>Hierom</hi> and others, amongſt other things, condemne ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond marriages ſo greatly as they did. Not conſidering that as <hi>Chryſom.

So of <hi>David</hi> when he married <hi>Bathſhebah,</hi> though it is moſt probable he had no wife, yet he had Concubines, then afterwards, as 2 Sam. 16.21. ſheweth, yet ſtill was ſhe his wife, and ſo accounted to his dying day; ſo of others might be ſaid. Beſides, though Chriſt hath allowed it to the innocent party, that he or ſhe may commence the action, and being judged, put the other away: yet no where hath he coman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, that he ſhould put her away, which if ſhe had ceaſed to be a wife, he would. Math. 19.9. Againe, onely he that joyned them can ſeparate them, and make them not man and wife, which is God only: that he did by the Miniſter, this by the Miniſter and Magiſtrate, Math. 19.6. <hi>Hierom</hi> reports of <hi>Fabiola,</hi> that without the judgement of the Church, or Magiſtrate, ſhe put away her husband, being a vitious and an adulterous man, and full of all
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:151759:193"/>filthy luſts. But though hee writ not the reſt, yet others report, that ſhe was made to doe publique pennance, not that ſhe made a divorce, but that ſhe did it of her ſelfe without the iudgement of the Church.</p>

A woman cannot releaſe her joyncture in prejudice of her ſelfe, nor a man take it from her, if ſhe were willing to the prejudice of her eſtate, unleſſe it be done before a lawfull Judge. How then this, that is ſuch a prejudice to her and many others? A recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance made in the Court of Chancery cannot be releaſed but by the conſent of the ſame Court. And when a recognizance is made to God, can man releaſe it without his conſent?</p>
                        <p>It reproveth thoſe who as unſoundly, as boldly, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> deliver that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter adultery is committed, ſpecially if it be known, ſo long as they live together afterwards, they live as adulterers. Can man and wife be adulterers? I would thinke not by the meere act of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another; nay ſure, not now the Prophet faith they are man and wife ſtill. Neither is there any place in the Scripture that bindeth theinnocent party to put away the nocent, but gives him liberty if he will; and if he be not bound to it, it is no adultery if he doe it not, but live ſtill with her. But adultery hath broken the bond of marriage? I know it well, yet not ſo but the innocent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may if he will repaire it and knit it againe; ſpecially if ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, both charity and piety requires; but if not, why he may not, if he will, I know not. As in the matter of offence from a man when he repents, he is not onely bound to doe it, as Luke 17.3, 4.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:151759:194"/>but if he doe it, without repentance, in private injuries, not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to the common good, I thinke he is not reproveable. So in this. And though it were horrible for a man to beare ſuch an indignity from his wife, if ſhe ſhall continue in it, to bring the judgement of God upon him and his houſe; yet if he paſſe it over once or twice upon hope, he is not an adulterer, though he go in unto her: for they are ſtill man and wife.</p>
                        <p>To inſtruct married parties, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> that notwithſtanding a fault be committed, yet they remaine man and wife; and it is in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to repaire the breach, the one by repentance, and the other by pardoning: and better a great deale it ſhould be ſo, then the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce ſued out; to make up the breach privately, rather then bring it publicke. That which the Scripture commends in <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> Mat. 1. may by proportion inſtruct men not to traduce their wives ſo ſoone as they have offended, but ſeeke to reclaime them private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Men that have taken a wound in ſome ſecret and uncomely part, will aſſay to cure it privately, before they goe to a Phyſitian: They ſhould do ſo in this.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:151759:196"/>expreſſed the conjunction of marriage to have ſaid, this is now fleſh of my fleſh, and ſoule of my ſoule; then as he did. To this we adde Eccleſ. 12.7. <hi>Duſt returnes to the earth as it was, and the ſpirit returnes to God that gave it.</hi> And Iſaiah 42.5. and 57.16. <hi>The ſouls which I have made,</hi> Zach. 12.1. <hi>The Lord formeth the ſpirit of man within him.</hi> Heb. 12.9.

                        <p>Becauſe if it were propagated, <label type="milestone">

                        <p>This ſerves to confute their opinion, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> who thinke that the ſoule is propagated, and not created, comes from God by the parents, and not from the power of God immediately. It would be too too tedious, &amp; not ſo profitable to make anſwer to all the reaſons they bring, which are of a contrary opinion; yet not to paſſe over ſome common ones which are toſſed up and downe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of men, who have entered into this queſtion. It is an uſuall objection with them, that which troubled St. <hi>Auguſt. in lib.</hi> 10. <hi>ſup. Geneſ.</hi> That is God doe now create ſoules, how ſhould that be true, that in the ſeventh day he reſted from all his workes, <hi>i.</hi> the workes of creation, as it is generally taken; how then ſhould he create ſouls? To anſwer, I demand whether that Chriſt his ſoule was propagated from his Mother, or created? If they ſay it was propagated, they muſt needs ſay it was tainted with ſinne originall: If they ſay it was created, which the learned affirm, S. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> and others, becauſe it could not betainted with ſinne, then have they anſwered for us, that ſoules are now created. And the meaning of God ceaſing from his worke, is that which the learned give, that after the ſixt day he crated no new kinde
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:151759:196"/>of creatures or things, though he doe ſtill make particulars of kindes.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, they ſay, man begets a man, and the mother brings forth a man of body and ſoule like themſelves. But admit this, they beget and bring forth onely one part, and not the whole, then they beget and bring forth not like themſelves.</p>
                        <p>In anſwer, and demand, did not God make <hi>Eve</hi> of <hi>Adam?</hi> It will not be denyed; yet did he make but her body, and created her ſoule? And if that ſpeech be true, why not this? though but the body onely is propagated.</p>
                        <p>Againe, I demand, brought not <hi>Mary</hi> forth our Saviour Chriſt a true and perfect man, and like her? It is granted; yet was his ſoule created of God, and not propagated, confeſſed of all. Then ſo in this. And the reaſon is given, becauſe in the body which is traduced and propagated from the parents, by vertue of the ſeed, there are qualities and conditions found by which it is made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a reaſonable ſoule, and ſo becauſe of that, the ſoule it ſelfe is ſaid to be propagated from the patents. And thus the ſchoole probably diſputeth.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, they ſay, if God create all ſoules, then his which is begotten by adultery, and ſo is the author of ſinne, or elſe a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worker, or a worker with the adulterers.</p>
                        <p>I anſwer firſt, a difference is to be put betwixt the action and the evill of it: God who workes in the action, is free from the evill: as in the betraying of Chriſt and murdering, all move in him and worke by him, but the evill is of themſelves.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it is anſwered by ſome, that there muſt be put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, betwixt the action of an adulterer, and his will. The acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſimply and of it ſelfe is not evill, but of things indifferent, or naturally good; the will is evill. God workes in the action, but approves not his will. S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſt. Epiſt.</hi> 28. <hi>ad Auguſt.</hi> ſet it out by this ſimilitude. The earth hath this goodneſſe from God in it ſelfe, that what ſeede ſoever men caſt into it, it keepes it and nouriſheth it, and it brings forth fruit, whether the ſeede be lawfully taken out of a mans owne ſtore and garner, or it be ſtollen; neither for thy theft or corruption refuſeth it to take, to nouriſh, and to returne with fruit. Yet will none for this accuſe the goodneſſe of the ground, nor God who hath made it fruitfull for this purpoſe: ſo God, who is goodneſſe it ſelfe, if any goe in unto a woman, whether lawfully, or unlawfully, doth not ceaſe according to his decree, and firſt ordering of things, to worke with a man in framing the birth, and creating the ſoule, yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves he no more his adultery, then the others theft; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes and will puniſh them both. Laſtly, by this reaſon a man may deny God to have any finger in the framing of the body, as that he ſhould not create the ſoule.</p>
                        <pb n="126" facs="tcp:151759:197"/>
                        <p>Fourthly, they ſay if ſoules be thus created, then how ſhould they be infected with originall ſinne? Is it becauſe it is joyned with the body? but how ſhould that be when as a corporall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance can have no power over a ſpirituall? and how ſhould God be free from ſinne, but be Author of it, when he joyneth a pure ſoule with a ſinnefull and corrupt body? To this I anſwer, firſt, for the firſt part. That in originall ſinne, two things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. Firſt, <hi>Adams</hi> diſobedience, as the head and roote of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, imputed moſt juſtly to them, as to his members. The reaſon is, becauſe as <hi>Adam</hi> received his juſtice for them all, ſo did he his injuſtice and ſinne, being not a private man, but the head and fountaine of all mankind, in reſpect of both, where they are called not perſonall juſtice or injuſtice, but originall. The ſecond is the corruption of the whole nature and the propenſion and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of it to evill, which is the puniſhment of that diſobedience which from him to his whole poſterity, is by the juſt judgement of God derived and propagated. Now when we ſay that from the conjunction of ſoule and body, it is defiled and infected with both theſe, we meane not as when a piece of gold falls into the dirt or mire, or as wine that is put into a muſty caske is corrupted by them: But becauſe the firſt is imputed to the whole man this diſobedience oif <hi>Adam,</hi> as if it were his owne; for as when he is made a member of Chriſt by the holy Ghoſt, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is imputed to him, and he is truely called a juſt man. So, ſo ſoone as he is made a man and the member of <hi>Adam,</hi> this is. And ſecondly, becauſe of the guilt of that diſobedience, the corruption of nature and the propenſion and inclination to evill which they uſually have called contagion, is by the juſt decree &amp; ordination of God derived into the ſoule, he having ſo decreed from the beginning, that if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood &amp; not ſinned, his whol juſtice ſhould have beene propagated to his poſterity, whence it is called originall juſtice. So he falling and all his poſterity ſinning in his loyns, the whole corruption of the nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> which followed that diſobedience, ſhould flowfrom him as from a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine into all men, that is, both into the body and ſoule. Whence it is called naturall corruption, and originall ſinne. Thus then is the ſoule infected, as the body, but yet not from the body by any phyſicall contraction or contagion, but by this courſe, and hath no need to be propagated, or elſe it cannot be infected by originall ſinne.</p>
                        <p>Now that God by this meanes is not the Author of ſinne, or the pollution of the ſoule, becauſe he hath joyned it to the body, is manifeſt, becauſe he never infuſed any evill either into the body or ſoule, for he tempts no man, James 1. Againe, God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed before all times and ſo would performe, to joyne the ſoule and body together, as well if <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood, as if he fell. Now what
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:151759:197"/>reaſon was there that ſinne comming betweene, or God foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, ſhould hinder his decree, becauſe of it. This decree being moſt holy and juſt, he therefore in joyning theſe together, hath done that which he moſt holily, juſtly, and wiſely decreed. And that corruption followed upon this, is not from the conjunction, for then it would have beene, though <hi>Adam</hi> had not fallen, but by the default of man, who is in this thing to be blamed not God: And ſo neither the propagation of originall ſinne, neither any juſt imputation that can be laid upon God, can overthrow the creation of the ſoules, or eſtabliſh the propagation of them.</p>
                        <p>This may teach us the excellency of the ſoule above the body, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> the matter and the maker oftentimes commends a thing and makes it more excellent. So of theſe. The body is made but of the ſlime of the earth, or the ſlime of man, and that by the inſtrument of man, and is but ſtill duſt and aſhes, the ſoule is made immediately of God, and though of nothing, yet is made a matter more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then the matter of the heavens,<note place="margin">Ambroſe.</note> in nature not inferiour to the Angels. And this ought to ſtir up in every man a more ſpecial care for the ſoule, then the body; for the health, happineſſe, and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the one, more then of the other. Not as many who beſtow more case upon their dogges and horſes and other beaſts, then upon their ſoules, and yet they would not be accounted dogges and beaſts: But their bodyes they onely ſeeke to pamper, and ſtarve their ſoules, and ſuffer them to periſh: for that they care, and this they neglect: they are like unto thoſe who having a rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous houſe, regard it not, and onely ſeeke to themſelves goodly orchards: or thoſe who are conſumed by a diſeaſe, neglect the care of their health, and make them apparell of cloth of gold and ſilver, and ſuch like. Or like a ſick woman who neglects the means of her recovery, and onely labours and endeavours to have wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting maides, Jewels and other ornaments. How fooliſh are all and every one of theſe, in every ſober mans judgement? Then what wiſedome is it for men not to regard the ſoule, labouring with ſinne, and to prepare themſelves with all endeavour ſtarely houſes, great Lordſhips, many troopes of ſervants, dainty fare, and fine apparell for the backe and belly. As if this, not that, were more excellent; as if the body, not the ſoule were of ſo excellent a nature, as if man had begotten that, not this. But ſeeing it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, our care ſhould be contrary, as <hi>Iaakob</hi> laid his right hand upon the younger, but his left upon the elder, ſo our beſt care and the ſtrength of our thoughts ſhould be for the ſoule, younger as much as it is, then the body; they ſhould but be left hand thoughts for the body, <hi>vide Bern ſerm.</hi> 6. <hi>de advem. dom. s. d. e.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To inſtruct parents to take more eare for the ſoules of their children then uſually they doe, ſeeing they are thus created, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:151759:198"/>ſo in a more ſpeciall manner Gods. The little care they take for it, and the great care for the body, tells us, that they believe this is theirs, and not that. And as men care more for their owne then for other mens, and many a man beſtowes more coſt and care upon a houſe of his owne erecting, then of one of his fathers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding: ſo in this. But the contrary ſhould be, that they ſhould principally care for this, and for that, but in reſpect of this. God having to duſt and aſhes joyned ſo excellent and immortal a ſoule, put in ſuch an earthly tabernacle ſo excellent a Prince. Though they ought to have care to keep that in reparation and tenantable, yet their ſpeciall care ſhould be for this; for the diet, the cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the admorning and the beautifying of it, with good graces and vertues; whereas contrary the care of parents now is, onely for the bodies of theirs, how they may cloath them with ſcarlet, with pleaſures, and hang them with rich ornaments oif gold upon their apparell, 2 Sam. 1.24. to ſet them out with Lawnes and Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brickes, and deck them with all the vanities ſpoken of, Iſaiah 3. as if they would provoke God to plague both body and ſoule. But is it any marvell, when moſt parents care onely for their owne bodies, and not for their ſoules? How ſhould they care for the ſoules of their children, ſeeing charity ever begins at home? To them the Prophet ſpeaketh, at leaſt by way of alluſion, as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by ſome of the learned, Haggai 1.2.4. <hi>They ſay it is not yet time to looke to Gods houſe and his worke:</hi> that when they are old, they are afraid to be young Saints, they or theirs, they let Gods houſe lye waſte, and his field grow over with weeds, the ſoules of themſelves and their children. If they would conſider their wayes in their hearts, they ſhould finde God plagues us for this ſinne, as for others, verſe 6.7. If any man ſhould hang thy houſe, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne it with cloath of gold, and hanging of Arras, and ſhould compell thee to ſit naked in aſhes, wouldſt thou take it well? thou wouldſt not. Now not another, but thou thy ſelfe adorneſt the houſe of thy ſoule with gold and pearles, and ſuffers thy ſoule to ſit in filthineſſe and corruption: ſo of thy children. How ſhall God take it at thy hands? Knoweſt thou not that the Prince of the Citie ought to be magnifically deckt? <hi>Chryſoſt de diverſis hom.</hi> 70. Let every man then remit off his care for the one, and increaſe it for the other. And let it not be true in this, that the Kings work and the Church worke, is moſt negligently looked to. But as <hi>Kiſh, Sauls</hi> father, ceaſed earing for the Aſſes, and cared for <hi>Saul,</hi> who muſt be King; ſo for the ſoule, ſeeke to have it nouriſhed, and decked, and adorned.</p>

And if any except that two is not there expreſſed, he may finde it, Matth. 19.5. Further, verſ. 9. And if he that puts her away, may not doe it, what he that keeps her? If adultery in the one, how not in the other? Prov. 5.18.19.

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> ſerves to confute all of the contrary minde, as ſometime was that Apoſtata <hi>Bernard Ochin,</hi> who hath written certaine dialogues, and laboured to eſtabliſh this againſt the word of God. Infinite it were to trouble you with all, yet ſome: The greateſt is the examples of many of the holy Fathers, as recorded in the Scripture, who had many wives, and are no where repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. I anſwer; Firſt, it followes not, Their reproofe is not ſet downe, therefore it was not: for ſeeing the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves it, why may it not be ſuppoſed others did ſo? Beſides, many things were done, that we never finde reproved, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues not the lawfulneſſe of them. The inceſt of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Lot, Davids</hi> judgement againſt <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> and with <hi>Siba,</hi> and ſuch like. Thirdly, if it were not, yet we live by precept, not example. Fourthly, the multitude, nor the greatneſſe of offenders will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, neither can antiquity preſcribe againſt the word of God. But as for the Fathers, it is anſwered by the learned: Firſt, that God remitted his law to them, which appeares, ſay they, becauſe he neither reproved it by his Prophets, neither did he at the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of the Law, expreſſely condemne it, as he did ſome others, as inceſt, Levit. 19. before they thinke <hi>Iacobs</hi> marriage of two ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters was lawfull, therefore he remitted his law: yet ſo, as they were not without all ſinne in it. For ſinne they conſider either as an aberration or turning aſide form the perfect rule of God, and ſo they ſinned: or elſe that which offends God, ſo that it provokes him to puniſh; and in this ſenſe they ſinned not, God thus remitting the Law. Others excuſe the Fathers becauſe they did it, and God ſo permitted for the increaſe of the Church, and not for any filthy &amp; unclean luſt to ſatisfie it: which was true in ſome, though it hold not in others. As <hi>Solomon</hi> and ſome others who cannot be excuſed of incontinencie. Some excuſe, from ſome probable ignorance, that either they knew not the Law, or they thought not of it, and ſo, though not no ſinne, yet a leſſe ſinne. Some, the ſucceeding ages by their predeceſſors, that though their examples make not ſinne to be no ſinne, yet to be ſmaller ſinnes to offend by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, who were otherwiſe good and holy men, then when any
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:151759:199"/>thing is done with a wavering conſcience, and men are bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the firſt that doe it, for they are to be judged to ſinne by error of judgement, then perverſity of affection. Finally, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that God did winke at that in this people and their proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitours, for thepropagation of his people, and to give paſſage to the fulfilling of his promiſe of the increaſing of them; and though God uſed that fact of the fathers well, yet will it not follow that they ſinned not, when they turned aſide from the word of God; but if they ſinned in it, and ſo perſevered, and dyed impenitent, what ſhall we thinke became of them? It is probable they never repented, either becauſe they thought they ſinned not, or elſe becauſe they well diſcerned not their ſinne; and yet might be pardoned it, and were. It is true, to have Gods mercy for pardon requires repentance, yet is it not neceſſary that every man ſhould expreſſely repent himſelfe of every particular ſinne. How many things are done, which are not rightly done? yet not done wickedly by us, but in a conſcience not well informed, and ſo knew it not to be ſinne? And how many which are forgotten that they were done? and yet by a mans generall humiliation for all his ſinnes, and craving pardon of unknowne ſinnes, Pſal. 19. pardon is obtained: And thoſe fathers often in their lives confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves miſerable ſinners, and humbling themſelves, no doubt that repentance, and faith in Chriſt to come, did ſave them.</p>
                        <p>But 2 Sam. 12.8. <hi>David</hi> had his maſters wives. It is anſwered by ſome that he did, becauſe God remitted his law to him. But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it is never read that he took any one of them to wife; neither is it ſaid ſo, but though the phraſe, into thy boſome, is commonly underſtood of marriages, yet it ſignifies there onely power and authority: that is, I have given thee all thy maſters goods, and have not excepted his wives, that thou maiſt have them under thy power as other things, <hi>Tremolius</hi> thus <hi>i. res &amp; perſonas etiam inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas &amp; chariſsimas, eorum qui prius tui er ant domini, ſubjecitibi.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But Deut. 25.5. the brother was to take the wife of his elder brother deceaſed. It is anſwered by moſt that it was an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary example, and a ſpeciall thing, but no generall rule: for elſe inceſt might be proved by it, if it were generall. Others anſwer, that it muſt be taken and underſtood, if he have not a wife before. And ſo much they thinke thoſe words carry, if brethren dwell together. And a reaſon of it is, becauſe it is not like that God would have a man to neglect his owne ſeed, and his owne wife to raiſe up ſeed to others, but onely he would have his brother ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in his place.</p>
                        <p>I omit many more of no great weight, though of ſome ſhew, againſt all which the truth will ſtand and prevaile.</p>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:151759:200"/>Church or by reaſon of their ignorance and rudeneſſe, winked at it: yet as in another caſe. Acts 17.30. <hi>The time of this ignorance God regarded not, but now he admoniſheth all men every where to repent.</hi> So may we ſay in this; ſpecially ſeeing Chriſt by himſelfe and by others his Apoſtles, hath declared us the law of the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and brought it to the firſt inſtitution, he beingas Revel. 1. Alpha and Omega; and as <hi>Hierom</hi> applies it to this when he found all things at his comming brought to Omega, to an extremity and height, he reduced them to Alpha, to that which was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. And if it were then granted to be no ſinne, yet will it be now. They who excuſe the fathers, make as of man, ſo of the world, foure ages: the childhood of it, the youth, the mans eſtate, and the old age. Now many things are fitting for children and may be tolerated in them, which may not be in men of riper yeares: as S. <hi>Auguſt</hi> ſaith, inold time for men to goe with garments having long ſleeves and skirts, it was an argument of ſoftneſſe and wantonneſſe. But now if they ſhould weare them with either, they ſhould be noted. They ſay againe, that that was the time of darkeneſſe, ours of the light; for though they were light in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Gentiles, they are darkeneſſe in compariſon of us. Now many things are tolerable in darkeneſſe, which may not be borne withall in the light. Then in this, as in many other things, we muſt not ſtudy what was done or borne withall, but what is lawfull for us to doe, and walke not in this, and many other things, as others have done, but as God hath ſpoken.</p>

The daughters of a ſtrange God, ſuch as profeſſed the worſhip not of the true God. The meaning of this is manifeſt by that which we have in Ezra 9.1.2. the holy ſeed matched with the people of the land; namely they who profeſſe true religion, and the true God, with thoſe who falſifie both. Alſo 1 Cor. 7.14. where holineſſe is nothing but to be within the Covenant and profeſſors of the true God and religion.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:151759:201"/>yet not the Church: for that will ſpread rather idolatry then the true worſhip. Deut. 7.3.4. and Ezra 9.1.2. Hence it is that amongſt the people of God, that virginity was a griefe and barrenneſſe, a ſhame and ſo taken and accounted; becauſe they could not increaſe the Church: for the firſt, ſee Judges 11.37.40. for the ſecond, ſee Luke 1.25.

Certaine it is many of them take barrenneſſe for a croſſe, and a reproach unto them, but it is onely becauſe they have not little ones to ſolace themſelves withall, when they are young, or to leave their wealth to, when they are of yeares, but never to propagate by them the Church, and true worſhip of God. It may be in our times they leave not unto them falſe worſhip, but that is onely thankes to the ſtate, not them; who if the ſtate did ſo beare it, would as well leave the one as the other to them. And that I may not ſlander them, I prove this from their choyſe, and from their uſe of their marriage eſtate. The firſt is apparent that they chooſe onely for beauty, though they be the daughters of men; or for riches, for portion or perſon, &amp; never reſpect religion; nay if there be the other to be had, though their religion be ſuſpected, and it be either none or corrupted; they will not forbeare ſuch marriages, though they joyn themſelves to the daughters of a ſtrange God, at the beſt but the daughters of men, never ſeaſoned nor yet inclinable to the truth and true worſhip. In the law he that would not marry his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed brothers wife, but another, manifeſted that he never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to raiſe up feede to his brother: So in this. He or ſhe that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not with the daughters of God, ſhew they never intend this.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:151759:201"/>Againe, in the uſe of marriages; many men and women, though they deſire ſome children, not many; and thoſe they have, they may happily give them civill breeding and education, and bring them up in knowledge of humane things, arts and ſciences, and ſuch like, but no inſtruction of religion. That which S. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> complaines of to God as touching his father, may many juſtly complaine of their parents. <hi>Non ſatageret idem pater, qualis creſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem tibi, aut quam caſtus, dummodo eſſem diſertus.</hi> So they have little care for piety and religion, to informe them and inſtruct them that way, but that they might as he ſaith, <hi>ut diſcerem ſermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem facere, quam optimum &amp; perſuadere dictione.</hi>

Thirdly, a remedy againſt incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, though all muſt be aimed at, yet principally this. The other a man may well have, and have a lawfull marriage, but without this it can be nothing ſo holy a marriage, ſeeing it wanteth the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall and the moſt holieſt end, which was the end of it even in mans innocency, when he was without ſinne. Therefore ought every one principally to aime at this, and indeed to have it; and therefore ought they to chuſe ſo, or give conſent that this may follow; not with thoſe who have a falſe religion, or no religon, becauſe it hardly will be that the Church ſhould be increaſed by them; for children will ever follow the worſe part, though it be the weaker: for a little ſtrength drawes downward, it muſt be a great ſtrength that muſt pull upward. Corruption is downeward and with the tyde: Religion is upward and againſt it. And having a fit match, children ought to be deſired of them, and to account it their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.

And as <hi>Hierom adfuriam;</hi> why doth the tongue ſound out chaſtity, and the whole body ſhew forth uncleanneſſe? Or as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> of the <hi>Origeniſts:</hi> You refuſe marriage, but not luſt. It is not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe but hypocriſie that is in honour amongſt you. Beſides this, virginity is never ſave onely in ſome reſpect better then mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, but marriage is oftentimes abſolutely better then virginity, and by no reaſon more then this; becauſe this may increaſe the Church, and bring forth ſonnes and daughters to God, not that. Neither is it againſt this, that ſome object, that Chriſt ſaith, That after this life there is no marrying at all, and that, 1 Cor. 7.38. <hi>He that giveth her to marriage doth well, but he that giveth her not to marriage, doth better.</hi> For the firſt, it is not againſt us, ſeeing we ſpeake of the ſtate of this life onely; after which, as there ſhall be no marriages, ſo no vowes of virginity. And as for S. <hi>Paul, Better</hi> with him, is as much, as fit, or more commodious. For if it were ſimply better, it were never lawfull to do otherwiſe, which he alloweth. Therefore he thus ſpake, not for the nature of the thing, but in reſpect of circumſtances, as you may ſee, verſe 26.28.32.35. Finally, if virginity be the more holy, why have they made marriage a ſacrament rather then it? Sure, if it were more holy, it ſhould rather be a ſacrament, then marriage.</p>

In the verſe we obſerve two things: Firſt, the reproofe of this ſinne: ſecondly, an admonition generall, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the particular. In the firſt, which is the ſinne, we obſerve the amplifications of it, which is firſt from Gods hatred: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, from an effect of thoſe husbands, who uſed and practiſed divorces, that they made the law of God a covert, to cover with it that violent injury and indignity they did to their wives, as men cover the body, and defaults of it with their garment.</p>

                           <hi>If thou hateſt her, put her away.</hi>] Some thinke this dependeth upon the former, as an objection made by this people in their own
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:151759:204"/>defence, againſt the former accuſation, as unjuſtly caſt upon them, becauſe they had not committed Polygamy, ſeeing they had put away their firſt wives, and that according to the Law, Deut. 24. The Prophet anſweres, the Lord hates putting away, and will not indure that they ſhould make his Law a cover for their iniquity. Some, as S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> underſtand them as words of the Prieſt and people in their owne defence, pretending the law of God for that they did; but moſt take them as Gods words, ſhewing his diſlike of their dealing. And if the words be read thus, as our vulgar tranſlation hath them: then they think them ſpoken by an Irony, which they manifeſt, as they ſuppoſe by the words following, by which they take a judgement to be threatned. And they thinke it is manifeſt by the like, Eccleſ. 11.9. but ſeeing the words in the originall will not beare the reading, neither the ſecond ſentence will carry the ſenſe they would have of them; They muſt be thus read: <hi>For I hate putting away;</hi> or, <hi>putting away is an hatred unto me.</hi>] It is a thing that I am ſo far from approving and liking, that I utterly hate and abhor, whatſoever <hi>Moſes</hi> for the hardneſſe of your hearts did grant unto you, and ſo remitted the judiciall law, that it proceeded not againſt you to death, as adulterers, when you had put them away for ſlight cauſes, and married others; yet that hath not excuſed it before me, but that it is ſtill a ſin, and odious unto me.

For they who governe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:151759:205"/>common wealths, propound this end unto themſelves, that if two evills, or two inconveniences happen and meete, they admit the leſſe, leſt they fall into the greater. As in ſome Cities they have admitted ſtewes and harlots, to avoide, as they ſay, greater evills, which the law of God will not ſuffer in his common wealth. And ſo to this purpoſe of marriage, when unhappy, unfit, and unequall marriages are made; the one of theſe two inconveniences ſeemed to be neceſſarily; that they who hated their wives, would either perpetually afflict and vex them, and at length kill them, or they muſt have liberty to put them away.<note place="margin">The permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion argues no ſimple lawfulneſſe.</note> This latter was thought more tolerable, therefore it was allowed in that common wealth; but ſo allowed as if God by it would make them keepe their wives, and uſe them better. For firſt, God would have him make a bill of divorce, by that to affect ſo hard &amp; cruell a husband, &amp; to drive him to conſider what an unfit &amp; unworthy a thing it was for him to put away one he had enjoyed ſo long; for we uſe to weigh more thoſe things we write, then thoſe we ſpeake. Secondly, that if he put her away, he was not allowed atall to take her againe, and therefore to make him not to doe it, but adviſedly, when happily upon ſecond thoughts he would not doe it. Thirdly, if he gave her a bill of divorce, it muſt expreſſe the cauſe why he did it, clearing her that it was not for adultery, and accuſing himſelfe that it was for ſome other ſlight cauſe, which he ought and would, if there had been any love in him at all, have covered. All which ſheweth, that God did it for their infirmities, and would have reſtrained them from it by this meanes; and that he granted unto them was onely judiciall, that is ſo much as might free them from the hand of the Magiſtrate, that they were not puniſhable by him, but not that which made it no ſinne againſt the law morrall; and before him, they were onely freed in <hi>fore civili, non conſcientiae.</hi> It is like to our law of uſury which frees men from puniſhment of the law if they take not above ſuch a ſumme, but frees them not from ſin before God, providing for the good of the borrower, both that they might borrow, and when they did, not be too much oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; but ſo, he that lends is an uſurer, and ſo a thiefe before God: So in this. For the Lord as a wiſe law-giver, in his judiciall lawes, permitted in a civill reſpect ſome things evill in themſelves, for the avoiding of a greater miſchiefe; not to allow or juſtifie the ſame from the guilt of ſinne, as before him in the court of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but to exempt the ſame from civil puniſhment in the external court before the Magiſtrate: ſuch is this we ſpeake of. Hence it is that we read not in the Scripture of any man of note for piety and holineſſe which ever uſed this, or ever gave any wife a bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce. For whereas <hi>Abraham</hi> put away <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Iſmael,</hi> it is not againſt this, for as he did it by the counſell of the wife, ſo by the commandement of God, Gen. 21.12. And none that were godly
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:151759:205"/>uſing, or practiſing it once, though they were ſubject to the ſame inconveniences that others were, and ſo ſhewes that they held it not ſimply, and in conſcience lawfull.</p>
                        <p>Againe, they ſay that 1 Cor. 7. the Apoſtle allowes divorce for another cauſe. It is anſwered, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh not of a divorce, but of a diſertion, not of putting away the wife for any fault of hers, but when ſhe forſakes the husband, for the faith and piety that is in him, and ſo <hi>è contra;</hi> for the Apoſtle onely ſaith, if the unbeleeving depart, let him depart. But allowes not the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever in any ſort to put away the unbeleever; nay, commands him to live with her, if ſhe will abide with him. And ſo onely enjoyneth him to ſuffer a diſertion, not to make a divorce. And ſo this eſtabliſheth no other cauſe.</p>
                        <p>Againe, they ſay, if for adultery, then much more for crimes greater then it, and ſo there are more cauſes of divorce. This will be anſwered out of the former: for if the Apoſtle allow not for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity then not for greater; for that is ſure farre greater; and if their reaſon were good, then would this follow: infidelity is a greater ſinne then adultery, therefore ought a man to be put to death for that, becauſes for this he owes to dye by Gods law. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, adultery doth not make the divorce, becauſe of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſin, but becauſe of the oppoſition of it to marriage, it is far more contrary to it. The reaſon is, becauſe in marriage man and wife ought to be one fleſh. Now adultery is that which doth divide them, and make not one, but two. And ſo doth neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, blaſphemy, idolatry, neither any ſuch ſin. For theſe and the like ſins are more repugnant to God, and ſeparate men from him more then adultery, but it is more oppoſite to Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; which is manifeſt, becauſe amongſt infidells, idolaters and blaſphemers, marriage is good and lawfull, though not holy.</p>
                        <p>Other things they object, as coldneſſe and inability of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable diſeaſe, if the one goe about to kill or poyſon the other, if the civill lawes allow it. But they are anſwered, that ſome of theſe may hinder a marriage it be not, not breake it when it is. In others the Magiſtrate is to be looked to for helpe. The lawes of Magiſtrates cauſing divorce for other things, if they be capitall they ought put them to death, and ſo end the controverſie. If cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall, of leſſe force, their law is againſt the law of God, and not tolerable.</p>

He that is able to receive this, let him receive it.</hi> For to ſome who cannot abſtaine, marriage is as neceſſary as meat, drinke, and ſleepe, as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid ſometimes; foolliſhly cavelled at by our Papiſts. That is then not the uſe of it, but this; for men to be wary how they chuſe, and women how they are perſwaded, or give conſent, ſeeing it is a knot not to be broken againe for any diſlike, or diſcontents whatſoever, ſave onely in the matter of adultery. If it were a matter as common bargaines be, that a man might loſe his earneſt, if it were with ſome hazard of his hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and good report: Or if they were taken, as ſome men take prentices, upon liking; or buy horſes to loſe ſo much, if they diſlike and return them; or if <hi>Solons</hi> law were in force, that he who did put away his wife ſhould give her dower and portion with her againe, it were the leſſe to be thought of; but when it is ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluble, not to be looſed or broken, but perpetuall, it requires a great care, when it is ſtronger and firmer then the bond betwixt parents and children: Therefore ſhould the man take heed how he chuſeth, for beauty, for profit, and great portion; and not for wiſedome, and vertue, though the other things be not in the like proportion. What is more profitable then the Bee, ſaith Saint <hi>Chryſoſt. in Pſal.</hi> 50. yet hath it a ſting? What fairer then a Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocke,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:151759:206"/>but the comelineſſe onely is in the feathers, not the fruit. So, many with their great portions, and great beauty, have often their ſtings, and are not fit helpes; that a man had better buy a wife, then be bought to her, ſpecially when there is no parting. And better to have had the contemptible Ant, as he ſpeaketh, which is the miſtriſſe of wiſedome, the meaner and the more huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifely, who may ſoone be worth her portion in good comfort and contentment; ſo the woman how ſhe is wonne, or perſwaded for the perſon or riches, or kindred of a man, becauſe he is able to cloath her in fine apparell, to decke her with gold and pearle, and many ſuch things, having no wiſedome to governe or inſtruct her, or to bring up his children in the inſtruction of the Lord, no love but luſt, for ſeeing the knot is perpetuall, and no cheyce al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed againe, ſhe may buy all that deare enough. Therefore it is good to be adviſed in their choyce, leſt repentance ſhould come too late, and be bought too deare, and yet make no amends, for they cannot be free. If the law of polygamy were in force, that a man might have two wives, the one hated, the other beloved, or this of divorce, he might put her away at his pleaſure upon diſlike, and ſo <hi>è contra,</hi> the matter were ſmall, and men might be as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of this as of the other things; but when as he hath made one for one, and made the bond ſo inviolable, that there is no parting till one be the others Executor: ſeeing things are thus, it is not good not to marry, but to be carefull how he or ſhe marrieth. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> perſwading men to be carefull of their ſoules, reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thus: <hi>Omnia nobis duplicia Deus dedit, duos oculos, duas aures, duas manus, duos pedes, ſingitur horum alterum laedatur per alterum neceſsitatem conſolamur: animam ver ò unam dedit nobis, ſi hane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diderimus, quanam vivemus.

But to avoid this, we muſt endevour to read the word without prejudice, or being fore-poſſeſſed with opinion. Many men make the Scriptures favour their errors, becauſe they read them with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute mindes to hold that they have, and ſo ſeeke but to confirme themſelves out of that they read, and apply it to their errors, and not their mindes to it; and ſometimes ſticke upon the letter, and ſometime make it ſpeake that it never thought; knowing not that it is like to a fertile field, which bringeth forth many things which nouriſh the life of man, without any ſeething or roaſting by the heat of the fire. Some things that are hurtfull unleſſe they be boyled. Some things unboyled offend not, and yet having felt the heat of the fire, are more wholeſome. Some that are in their kindes profitable for beaſts, though not for men: So the Scripture hath ſome things literally underſtood, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and help; as, <hi>Heare O Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> Others, unleſſe they be miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by the heat of the ſpirituall fire, and be ſpiritually under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, hurt more then profit, as that, <hi>Sell thy coat, and buy a ſword; If he ſtrike thee on the right cheeke; turne to him the left; Take up his

                           <p>Yee have wearied the Lord with your words: yet ye ſay, Wherein have we wearied him? When yee ſay, Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that doth evill is good in the ſight of the Lord, and be delighteth in them. Or where is the God of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>YE have wearied the Lord with your words.]</hi> The Prophet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth now unto the laſt ſin reproved in this Chapter, which was in this people; the former was touching men, this is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God: the former diſhoneſty and unfaithfulneſſe towards men, this impietie againſt God. Before he accuſed them, as ſome ſpeake, of felony, now of treaſon: before for their deeds, now for their words and ſpeeches, contumeliouſly uttered againſt God; denying the providence of God both over the good and bad, not providing for the one, and not puniſhing the other. It is thought that the Jewes being now returned out of Babylon from their captivity, and ſaw both the Babylonians, and divers other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and people, to abound with wealth, eaſe and glory, though they ſerved their Idols, and themſelves the onely worſhippers of the true God, to be in want and poverty, they thought and ſpake, that God he regarded not them that worſhipped him, but the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked were good in his ſight, and he delighted in them. Or at leaſt if it be not ſo, where is God that judgeth uprightly?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Yee have wearied the Lord with your words]</hi> Some thinke the wearineſſe here ſpoken of, is a fainting which commeth from too much ſtriving and labouring, whence commeth a remitting of the care and indevour which he tooke before time. And ſo the meaning they would have to be; You ſay the Lord, who is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, and aboundeth with mercy, and hath been ever conſtant in it, and prone to it; he is now wearyed in deſcending and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for, and in doing good unto thoſe that ſerve him. And ſo it ſhould not be a wearineſſe impoſed upon him, but one that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto him. And ſo onely in opinion it ſhould be ſo, and not in truth; but how this will agree with the Prophets anſwer to their demand, I cannot ſee, neither can it poſſibly: for then he would have ſaid, In that ye ſay, the Lord hath no care, or hath caſt
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:151759:209"/>of the reſpect of his; but he ſpeaketh otherwiſe. The meaning is, then you have grieved and vexed the Lord with your ſpeeches and reproaches and blaſhemies againſt him. It is ſpoken after the manner of men; becauſe they are ſo, with the ſpeeches of others, like that, Iſaiah. 43.24. <hi>Thou haſt wearied me with thine imquities.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Yet ye ſay wherein &amp;c.]</hi> Their anſwer for themſelves putting him to his proofe, and to make good that he had ſpoken, and ſhew wherein; elſe would they not confeſſe their faults.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>When ye ſay.]</hi> Though not in his hearing who was able and would reproove them; but amongſt the ignorant people in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, where they came, ſtill inculcating and repeating ſuch things, and ſo make them caſt off all feare of God, and care of honeſty and piety.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>He that doth evill.]</hi> Not the good nor the righteous is reſpected of God, but the wicked; for they flouriſh and proſper, and he is good in his ſight, that is approved of God.</p>
                        <p>From men they proceed to approach to God and to impeach, and diſgrace him, and caſt reproaches upon him; and being unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, injurious, and unjuſt to men, they are irreligious towards God.</p>
                        <p>They who are unfaithfull and unjuſt towards men, <label type="milestone">

                           </label> will be ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious towards God: ſuch as have no care of honeſty, will have no care of piety, not of charity, not of religion, and <hi>ècontra.</hi> So much this inſinuates: and that 1 John 4.20. <hi>If any man ſay I love God and hate his brother, he is a lyer; for how can he that loveth not his brother, whom he hath ſeen, love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi> And James 1.27. <hi>Pure religion, and undefiled before God, even the father, is this, to viſite the fatherleſſe, and widowes in their adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to keepe himſelfe unſpotted of the world.</hi> Tit. 2.12. Matth. 25.42. Not that men ſhall not be condemned for irreligion, but that this is manifeſt to others, and ſhewes that there can be no religion.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe men they ſee, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> and converſe withall daily, and ſo not with God. Now if they have no care of the preſent, what is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted towards the abſent; not of viſible, none of the inviſible: As 1 John 4.20.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe care of religion proceedeth from the love of God, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> which makes Chriſt, Math. 22.27. include the whole firſt table, which is concerning God and religion, under the title of love. Now there can be no love of God, but where there is love to man: for that 1 John 4.20. Men love not the perſon, if not the picture: love to man is naturall, to God ſpirituall; that as naturall men, this as ſpirituall and regenerate. If any be unnaturall, is it not like he will and muſt needs be irreligious?</p>
                        <p>To teach us not to wonder, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> as many men doe, that there is ſo much impiety and prophaneneſſe in our age, ſo little or no care
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:151759:209"/>of the Lords day, little or no love of the word, zeale for Gods glory, care of his worſhip, hatred of idolatry, and ſuch like, but <hi>ècontra</hi> much and great prophaning of the Lords day, &amp;c. Wee are in the age wherein charity is growne cold, and iniquity hath gotten the upper hand. It is true which <hi>Auguſt.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Euchi</hi> 1. <hi>ad Laur.</hi> 117. <hi>Regnat carnalis cupiditas ubt non eſt Dei charitas</hi> And it will be as true if <hi>ubi,</hi> be placed before <hi>regnat,</hi> for there can be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any true and conſtant love to religion, where there is not true love to God; that cannot be, unleſſe men be ſanctified and rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated. Now ſanctification, is as ſome ſay of hearts eaſe, that growes not in every mans garden, leſſe is it in every mans houſe; ſo not ſanctification, it is few mens hearts, and manifeſt not to be there where there is injuſtice &amp; diſhoneſty, no love of God: &amp; would we marvaile to ſee men performe no duties to thoſe they are knowne not to love? Love and affection being the ground of all duty, if not, why this? Nay rather ſeeing the wickedneſſe, injuſtice and oppreſſion of the time is ſuch, we ſhould rather won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der there is any religion at all, then that there is no more, that there is any love to the truth, &amp;c. then ſo little.</p>
                        <p>To teach us what to judge of many men who ſeeme religious, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> who will ſit at <hi>Gamaliels</hi> feet, have Chriſt to teach in their ſtreets and Churches, he ſhall eat at their tables and houſes, and yet they are workers of iniquity, live in ſome one groſſe ſinne or another, of injuſtice and oppreſſion, deceit or unfaithfulneſſe, and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; yea, after they have beene convinced by the word, remaine ſtill in them; know them to be but hypocrites, they may talke of religion, but they have no truth of it, they may have the ſhew of goodlineſſe, but not the power of it: They honor the word &amp; Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters onely, as <hi>Saul</hi> would have <hi>Samuel</hi> to accompany him, for his owne honor before the people, or ſome other ſiniſter reſpect. It is not a ſure conſequent a man is carefull of the duties of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond table, and therefore religious, becauſe hitherto by nature he hath beene ſo; &amp; there are ſome civil hypocrites as well as religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hypocrites; but the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequent is good: And oftentimes the iſſue of things proves not to be good; for though they hold out a while in ſuch profeſſion, yet at length they fall away, either when ſome trouble comes for it, that they may enjoy their lives and liberties, and ſo their ſinnes. And ſo as <hi>Inſt. Martyr Apol. Ret. Chriſtian,</hi> made his reaſon, that they were not as they were accuſed voluptuous, intemperate, and ſuch like, becauſe they ſo willingly embraced death for their profeſſions ſake; for then they would have renounced that, and deceived Princes to have enjoyed theſe: So on the contray. Or elſe they after twice or thrice ſtanding, are deprived of all that, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> was of his ſtrength by <hi>Dalilah.</hi>

I deny not but a man may have the truth of religion, and ſhould have wrong done him if he be otherwiſe judged of, and yet lye in ſome ſinne againſt the ſecond table; either becauſe he knew it not, or the ſtrength of the temptation hath blinded him, or the blow he had by it, hath for a while ſtammered him, as did <hi>David.</hi> But if they be once convinced of it and wakened as <hi>David;</hi> If <hi>Nathan</hi> have reproved them plainely, yet not ſo particular, yet ſo as they knew they were the men, if they hold on in that ſinne, it will ſoon make them irreligious; for it will make them out of love with the word and Miniſtery; and then he that judgeth ſhall have his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſealed up by God: And Chriſt ſhall make it good with that Luke 13.27. <hi>I tell you I know ye not, whence ye are, depart from me all ye workers of iniquity.</hi>

How uſuall this manner of judging is, is too too apparent; but how fallacious and deceitfull it is, may be as apparent; like that of <hi>Sinionides,</hi> who would have wealth better then wiſedome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the wiſe ſtood with cap in hand to the rich; ſo they the wealthy then the poore, becauſe they would have it to argue more favour, and ſo judge a man how wicked, at leaſt, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ſoever he be, if he have riches, and be in proſperity and plenty, and others hated; but theſe condemne the generation of Gods children: as Pſalm. 73. yea, they judge and condemne God himſelfe, as if he loved the wicked.</p>

We have a proverbe which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute theſe conceits, and better informe us; for uſually we ſay not, he is beloved of God that is rich, but he is rich that God loves, and ſo he is; for he is rich that a Prince loves, though he poſſeſſe him not with lands and livings; becauſe his love will ever admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter that which is neceſſary for his place and ſtate; but this is true, eſpecially if we underſtand it of ſuch a Prince as is not muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his minde, not mortall in his nature; he is rich that ſuch a Prince loves, which is onely God. But admit this; yet how ſhall a man know that God loves him, or how may a man judge who is beloved, if not by theſe outward things?

Therefore muſt we with <hi>David</hi> goe into Gods Sanctuary, and conſider not the beginnings nor the preſent ſtate, but the ends of theſe men, which will manifeſtly prove his providence, Gods dealing with them and his owne; like to Princes with their Hawke and Partridge, oir their ſtates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like the Partridge, and the other as the Hawke. The ſecond is, the time preſent, that this divers dealing of God with them, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues his providence, becauſe it is the way to ſalvation for the one, and to deſtruction for the other. As it argues the skill of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian and his wiſedome, having to deale with two patients; one deſperately ſicke, and he cares not for his health; the other ſo ſick as he may be recovered, he uſeth divers dyets and manner of uſage: So God deales with his.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Chapter are two things laid down: one an anſwer to the blaſphemies reproved, verſ 17. of the former, which is contained in the 6. firſt verſes. The other, an expoſtulation or conteſtation with them, of their propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, obſtinacy and other impiety, <hi>ad finem.</hi> For the firſt. The ſum of it is thus. Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hath God ſo ſhewed himſelfe a moſt equall and upright Judge, that yet before he manifeſted himſelfe a moſt mercifull father, and never yet condemned and puniſhed any people, or any Nation with deſtruction, baniſhment, or other puniſhment, but he firſt by his Prophets or by other means, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to draw them to repentance and their duty, from their madneſſe and corruptions. And ſo it comes to paſſe, that either truly repenting and deſiring the mercy of God, they obtaine par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or remaining obſtinate and impenient, they are moſt juſtly puniſhed. Now this ancient manner of ſhewing his judgements, either privately or publiquely, God commands here to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: for he ſaith he is about amoſt excellent worke, whereby he will make manifeſt to godly and ſound hearted men, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his mercy, and will give proofe of the ſeverity of his judgements to the wicked, and thoſe who are obſtinate in their ſin. The manner how this is expreſſed unto us, is, by a Propheſic of two perſons to come; the one of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> the forerunner, calling men to repentance, and ſhewing Gods purpoſe both touching the godly and the reprobate: The other of the Ruler and Saviour of the world, the Judge of quicke and dead, whoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable power is manifeſted both waies, both in ſaving of the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:151759:216"/>good and faithfull, and in judgeing and puniſhing the wicked. The Propheſie is then of two perſons, and of their duties. The firſt is <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>Behold.]</hi> Signifieth a certaine and a moſt famous and publique thing. And ſpeaking of this he uſeth the preſent tenſe; he noteth the certainty of it, that is as ſure as if it were already done, and as ſure as if it were beheld with their eies. But there is in this thing a difference betwixt the Prophet and the Evangeliſt, one giving it to Chriſt, the other unto the Father; divers reconcile them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly, but that which ſeemeth moſt plaine and true is this: That ſome works are proper to the perſons, to every one in their eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall proprieties; as to beget, be begotten, and proceed; and theſe are not communicable, but ſome are externall and common, and ſometimes are given to one perſon, ſometimes to another, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the unity of eſſence in the trinity of perſons. As Iſaiah 6.1. I ſaw the Law ſitting on a throne. Some thinke, St. <hi>Baſil</hi> and others, that it was the Father who appeared in that viſion. Yet John, 12.41. It is given to the ſonne. And Acts, 28.25. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it unto the ſpirit. So that which is ſpoken of the holy Ghoſt, 2. Pet. 7.21. is affirmed of the Father. Heb. 1.1. now like to theſe is this. The ſending of <hi>Iohn</hi> being common to both, is by the Prophet given to the Son, and by the Evangeliſt to God, or by Chriſt in the Evangeliſt, to ſhew that he was one in nature with the Father, and another in perſon. Now Angel heere is a name noting an office or miniſtery, and not an eſſence or nature. <hi>Cyr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                           <item>Secondly the place where he ſhould come; that is, the Temple. By which what ſhould be meant; divers men have divers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits.

So Chriſts ſending was not his incarnation, but his office; for then is he ſaid to come, when he began to preach, worke miracles, and execute his function. So John 1.26, 27. and Math. 3.11. By Temple then we underſtand literally the Temple at Jeruſalem, and in it the Church; for in it Chriſt ought to be, to teach, to do, and execute his calling and function, by the decree of God. And there to build himſelfe that ſpirituall Temple, which is made of living ſtones. And this ſome gather from the prepoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>El ad,</hi> which ſignifies not onely the place, but notes the cauſe and end as well, and ſo it is both to the Temple and for it; noting the ſpirituall Temple to the materiall Temple, and for the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that the type, this the truth.</item>

                        <p>Now the perſon of Chriſt is deſcribed. Firſt he is called the Lord, that is King and governour of his Church, of whom is that, Pſal. 110.1. Which Lord the Prophet affirmeth that they deſired, the Jewes all of them, ſome in one reſpect, &amp; ſome in another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him: ſome as an earthly King, and deliverer, and ſome as a ſpirituall King, and the true Meſſias, who ſhould be their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and ſaviour, from ſinne and the wrath of God, Luke 2.25.38.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Even the meſſenger of the Covenant.]</hi> The ſecond deſcription of his perſon, that he is the meſſenger or Angell ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was to reveale his Fathers will to his people, and to be their Prophet to teach them what God requireth of them. Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Angel of the Covenant, partly becauſe he was promiſed, and God did ſo Covenant with them to be their Prophet, Deut. 18.15, 16. and Rom: 15.8. and partly as ſome thinke, becauſe he it is that makes the Covenant, betwixt God and his people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mediator of it; and partly becauſe he is the meſſenger of the new law, or the new teſtament, wherein heavenly bleſſings are promiſed unto us.

As if he expected, that if they were the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they ſhould have more rejoyced in his preſence, and in him being come, then he could deſire the day and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. And ſo ought we to do. Seing Chriſt ſaith, Luke 10.23.24. <hi>Bleſſed are the eies, which ſee that ye ſee; for I tell you, that many Prophets and Kings have deſired to ſee thoſe things that you ſee, and have not ſeen them: and to heare thoſe things which ye beare, and have not heard them.</hi> It is that which if we ſee indeed by faith, makes us happy; For though we cannot ſee him now bodily, or heare him perſonally, as they who lived in ſame age, yet we may both hear the ſee him in the preaching of the Goſpel, face of face. As 2. Cor. 3.18. And ſo ought to rejoyce in him; Not as Chriſt ſaith of the Jewes touching <hi>Iohn,</hi> John 5.35. <hi>They rejoyced for a ſeaſon in his light:</hi> but more conſtanly, &amp; if we have faith, ſo well will.

So of this. And as by that God would kindle in them, a marvelous deſire, and an earneſt deſire, to have it effected, and accompliſhed; ſo would he in us a due eſtimation, and love unto it, being now accompliſhed: for being God hath provided better for us, then for them: as Heb. 11.40.

                           <p>But who may abide the day of his comming? and who ſhall endure, when be appeareth? for he is like purging fire, and like fullers ſope.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IN this verſe, the Prophet goes forward to deſcribe Chriſt, and firſt from his power, which is ſet downe to us two wayes; one by way of interrogation, which carries with it a kinde of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the other by two ſimilitudes. In ſome part is his power reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the wicked, in ſome other reſpecting the godly; the firſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition reſpects the wicked. <hi>Who may abide the day of his comming?]</hi> That is, which of the wicked. <hi>i.</hi> the day of Chriſts firſt comming how tolerable, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, and delightfull ſoever it be to the godly, how weake and baſe ſoever in the outward ſhew, with what outward weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and infirmity ſoever he come, yet will it be to the wicked full of trouble, terror and diſquietneſſe. Thus the Prophets and oracles of old did fortell it ſhould be, and this the Evangeliſts, and writers of the new Teſtament have ſhewed it to be, and that at his comming the wicked were marveilouſly troubled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Who ſhall ſtand when he appeareth?]</hi> Or who ſhall ſtand <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him?</hi>] This toucheth the godly: who can with his eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſuch a light and ſuch Majeſty? A metaphor borrowed from the ſunne, whoſe brightneſſe the eyes of men are not able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. <hi>i.</hi> the glory of the Sonne of God ſhall ſurpaſſe all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and that goodneſſe which he ſheweth in becomming man, and converſing with them, for their converſion and ſalvation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Who ſhall ſtand?]</hi> That is, ſaith one, who thinking of theſe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:151759:221"/>things, doth not faint as overcome with the admiration of it; ſo that as a man whoſe legges are not able to beare, he falls downe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>For he is like a purging fire.]</hi> The firſt ſimilitude expreſſing the power of Chriſt drawne from fire; noting out unto his, how he worketh both with the godly and wicked; for as it is the nature of fire, not onely to ſeparate droſſe from the mettall, and joyne things which are of one nature together, ſo things that are good, it makes more pure and perfect, but things that are impure, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes and turnes to nought: So Chriſt by his word deſtroyes the wicked and unbeleevers, and ſuch as reſiſt his will; but ſaves ſuch as are choſen, making them more and more pure and perfect.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And like fullers ſope.]</hi> Or like the fullers hearbe; an hearbe that fullers uſe, by which they purge and take out of garments, blots and ſpots of long continuance in them, and makes them bright and pure; as it is noted, Mark. 9.3. S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> in Jer. 2.22. The fullers hearbe, as it is commonly ſeene in the Province of Paleſtine, growes in greene and moiſt places, and to waſh away ſpots, hath the ſame force that Nitre hath. Signifying, that God makes the ſoules of his by his grace, moſt pure and moſt holy, that their workes ſhine forth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But who may abide the day of his comming?]</hi> By this ſome think is meant the trouble and deſtruction that fell upon the wicked at his nativity. Becauſe of that, Mat. 2.3. &amp; 21.10. But taking his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to ſignifie here his office, and the execution of it, and ſo the preaching of his word, as in the former verſe. The meaning I will take to be this; None of the wicked ſhall be able to abide his preaching and miniſtery; but the preaching and the miniſtery of it is that, which will caſt them down and deſtroy them, wound them and kill them.</p>
                        <p>The preaching of the word by Chriſt and his Miniſters, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                           </label> none of the wicked are able to abide it and ſtand before it; but it will deſtroy them and caſt them downe, wound them to the heart, and bring them to eternall deſtruction; ſo the interrogation affirmes ſtrongly. Hence, Rev. 2.12. a two edged ſword given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Who ſhall endure when he appeareth?]</hi> This ſentence divers of the Interpreters take to be but one with the former, &amp; the ſame double for the admiration of the power of Chriſt, in ſuch weakneſſe able to confound and overturne whatſoever, or whoſoever ſtands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. But others underſtand it, as a diſtinct ſentence, and read it ſomewhat otherwiſe: <hi>Hierom</hi> according to the Hebr. <hi>Quis ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit ad videndum cum?</hi> The <hi>Septuagints, Quis ferre poterit ut aſpiciat cum? Simile à ſole &amp; oculis.</hi> Who that hath but his naturall and blinde eyes, is able to behold him, &amp; underſtand the great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſalvation he brings, and is hid under the vaile of his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:151759:221"/>As if he ſaid, no naturall man by his owne underſtanding is able to ſee and conceive theſe things, they are hid from him, or too deepe for him. That which is gathered hence is this.</p>
                        <p>No naturall man of himſelfe is able to behold Chriſt, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine </seg>
                           </label> and to know him and the myſteries of ſalvation brought by him, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velat. 2.17.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>For he is like a purging fire.]</hi> The firſt ſimilitude by which he ſetteth forth the power of Chriſt, comparing him to fire; and this is to ſhew his dealing with the wicked, to whom he is a conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire, and ſo are they rather to be read; for neither doth the word ſignifie purging, neither yet ſeemes he to ſpeake of his purging power touching the godly, for that followeth in the third verſe. Therefore it is to be underſtood of his conſuming power, by which he confounds the wicked, and deſtroyes them. Now generally hence I obſerve.</p>
                        <p>For that it is uſuall with the Scripture ſpeaking of God and his power, his juſtice, mercy, tender regard of his, and ſuch like, to ſet them downe by ſuch things as are common and familiar and every day or uſually occurrent to the eyes and eares of men.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And like the fullers ſope.]</hi> The ſecond ſimilitude to ſhew his dealing with the godly, his owne, that he is like the fullers ſope, or the fullers hearbe, which as it hath a nature to purge and take ſpots out of garments, ſo it maketh them to have a luſter and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſhew or colour, making them freſh and white, Marke 9.3. noting the effect of Chriſt in his, that he maketh them white and pure; for though it is true that this hearbe doth purge away blots, and ſo might note the purging away of corruptions from his, yet becauſe that is the next ſimilitude: I obſerve this here.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt is to his, as the fullers ſope, or the hearbe of the fuller, <label type="milestone">

                           </label> making them pure and holy, giving them a luſter in their lives, in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe: And this is either perfectly, which is either in this life, by imputation of his holineſſe, putting on his garments upon them, as <hi>Ionathan</hi> did to <hi>David</hi> after their league; or elſe in the life to come by full perfection inherent, when they ſhall be like him in holineſſe and glory: Or it is partially and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne in this life, whereas they are inlightned, as the Moone by the Sunne, yet have their ſpots their errors, ſo are they ſanctified, and put in a new hew, as the fuller doth a cloth, or garment, yet the old threeds appeare in them. Of this is it here ſpoken, and for this is he thus called, and to this tends that, 1 Corinthians 1.30. <hi>But ye are of him in Chriſt Ieſus, who of God is made unto us wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification, and redemption:</hi> And Cap. 6.11. <hi>and ſuch were ſome of you; but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified in the name of the Lord Ieſus, and by the ſpirit of our God,</hi> Heb. 2.11.

                           <hi>There is no other place of amendement but in this life; for after this, every one ſhall have, what he merited here.</hi> Now this place is apparently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, of purging men from the ſin and corruption, and not from the puniſhment; And ſo cannot be underſtood of their purgatory, where only the puniſhment is ſatisfied for. Beſides the end of this purging is, that they may be fit to offer up lawful ſacrifice to God, but in theirs the ſoules offer up no ſacrifices, ſay no Maſſes there. Beſides this purgation is onely by Chriſt, through the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the holy Ghoſt, being the onely purgation that the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:151759:223"/>ſcripture acknowledgeth, &amp; therefore this cannot be an impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that. Iohn 1.29. <hi>Iohn ſeeth Ieſus comming unto him, and ſaith; Behold the Lambe of God, which taketh away the ſins of the world.</hi> Arguing a want and weakneſſe, in his paiment, if after it men muſt pay for it. But that there can be no ſuch thing, neither can any ſuch thing ſtand with the Juſtice of God, I prove thus: By a reaſon which <hi>Tertul. dereſurrectione carnis;</hi> and other of the Fathers uſe to prove the reſurrection of the body; For if in courſe of juſtice, it be neceſſary, that the body which hath been partaker with the ſoule, of all that hath been done, either in righteouſneſſe or ſin, be alſo partaker of the reward of either: and hereby there be inforced neceſſarily a reſurrection of the body, to be joyned with the ſoule, to be partaker thereof. We muſt from the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of juſtice conclude, that if there be a Purgatory, it ſhould be as well for the body as the ſoule: becauſe the body hath been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of thoſe pleaſures and delights, for which they tell us, that the ſoules pay deare in Purgatory fire. But they deny any Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory for the body, therefore they cannot truly affirme there is any for the ſoule. For thus ſhall the judgements of God be juſt, (ſaith <hi>Epiphanius in Ancorat.</hi>) whilſt both participate, either puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſin, or reward for vertue; which juſt judgement they greatly impeach, by laying upon the ſoule only, the puniſhment of thoſe ſins which have been committed by the whole man.</p>

If <hi>Bellar. l.</hi> 1. <hi>de ſancto. beatit. C.</hi> 20. give us it for a reaſon, why the Fathers before Chriſt, neither prayed in particular for the Church upon earth, neither were prayed to, becauſe they were abſent from God, and did not enjoy his ſight and preſence, but were in <hi>Limbus,</hi> and not in heaven. The ſame reaſon can e give them that for a long while after Chriſt there was none, becauſe it was doubted in the Church, whether the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:151759:225"/>faithfull departed out of this world be immediately received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven, and enjoy the happy preſence of God, or whether they remaine and ſtay in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, or ſome place of reſt, till the day of the reſurrection; yea, <hi>Iraencus, Iuſt. Martyr, Tertullian</hi> and others, thought that they abode in ſome part of hell, or in ſome hidden and inviſible place, ſequeſtred from the preſence of God til the ſecond comming of the ſon of man. Therefore muſt it follow that invocation is but an innovation. But to conclude, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they know not our wants, nor can take notice of our prayers, &amp; heare us, neither can we have any certainety of it; if it were ſo, and are certaine from the word of God, that our prayers ſhall be heard as well as theirs; We have not need to pray to them, nor reaſon to induce us to it; we neither in this nor any other thing adore them, but as S. <hi>Auguſt. de verâ religione.</hi> 55. <hi>We honour them for imitation, but adore them not for religion.</hi>

And theſe are religious hypocrites. On the other ſide, many there are who have care to deale juſtly, to performe faithfullneſſe to men, are mercyfull, liberall, loving, and kinde, &amp;c. Yet care not, or regard not the duties of religion: Are ſwearers, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaners of the Lords day, neglecters of the worſhip of God, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, negligent, drouſie hearers, and prayers, have little hatred of Idolatry, and leſſe love of the truth. And theſe are civill hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.

Haſt thou any knowledge of God, any love of the truth, any care of the Lords day, any feare of his great name, any love to heare, or to pray? See thou be carefull of juſtice, chaſtity, ſobriety, obedience, fidelity, and true love to men; Or elſe for all that, when thou thinkeſt to have Chriſt, for thy Saviour, thou ſhalt finde him but a ſwift witneſſe, and an irefull Judge againſt thee; So on the contrary. Many will eaſily grant me, that if a man be never ſo religious, ſo devout, and carefull of the firſt Table: yet if he be unjuſt, an extortioner, a murtherer, and ſuch like, As they Acts 28.5. judged of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo the Lord will not ſuffer him to live, but his judgements ſhall be upon him, and condemnation in the life to come. But if a man be juſt, chaſt, mercifull, and ſuch like, though he know not reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, be without the feare of God, and care of his ſervice, though a ſwearer, &amp; blaſphemer, a prophaner of the Lords day, yet he may do well enough, and no fear of periſhing, or judgement, and ſo will they ſpeake, both in life, and death; which is all one as if they ſhould thinke, a man which is guilty of felony, murder, and ſuch like, muſt needs be judged by the law of the land; but if not of theſe, though he be a traytor to the Kings perſon, yet is there no feare. But if a traytor ſhall die though not guilty of felony, and a felone, though not culpable of treaſon, by the juſtice of mans law; much more they who ſhall ſeparate theſe two Tables. Therefore muſt we endeavour, to be religiouſly honeſt, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly religious, to avoide the tranſgreſſions of both Tables, and to do the duties of them; leſt if we ſeparate theſe, we lay our ſelves open to the judgements of God in this life, and ſeparate our ſelves from the comfortable, and happy preſence of the Lambe, and him that ſitteth upon the Throne.</p>

The generall right, is, no man ought to ſpoyle another, or defraud him: fraud and rapine, is a heynous kinde of injury, and ſo the more great &amp; grievous, when it is joyned with greateſt audaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and contempt; as if they defraud, and rob him, to whom they owe much, whoſe authority they ought to reverence, and whom they ought greatly to honour: As the Prince, and the King, the Judge, and the Prieſt.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:151759:242"/>renounce his patrimony, that takes the mainetenance of the Church, which they will not yeeld unto; nay, reaſon is for the contrary, ſeeing that they may uſe both for the better credit of their miniſtery, and the better performance of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1 Tim. 3.2. <hi>To keepe hoſpitality.</hi> Secondly, then ſhould that law be in force, Numb. 18.26.28. And ſo there muſt be a high Prieſt or chiefe Biſhop to receive this, as the Pope did, and which is now appropriated to the crowne, but men will not contend for that. Thirdly, then that law of the tithe of the third yeare ſhould be in force, Deuter. 14.28.29. which is not approved or allowed. Fourthly, then ſhould I condemne all thoſe Churches and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where no ſuch law is obſerved; but men are otherwiſe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, (though queſtionleſſe nothing ſo fitly and competently) as living in a groſſe breach of the morall law. Fifthly, then ſhould I free all Cities who have not fields, nor Vineyards, Oxen nor Kine, Sheep nor other things that are titheable, from being bound by the morall law to pay and give mainetenance to their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; becauſe I finde not, neither directly in the word, nor by col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection gathered by any, that Merchants and tradſemen were bound to pay tithe of their merchandize and trades; but no reaſon, but 1 Cor. 9.11. And that they ſhould give mainetenance to thoſe who watch for them, and muſt give an account of their ſoules. Theſe with the like reaſons have prevailed with me to ſettle upon this, that tithes are not due by a perpetuall and the morall law, as if nothing elſe might come in the place of them: Yet I ſay, that tithes in our Land and Church, and in divers other Churches of Chriſtendome, where there are thing titheable, have their ground from the word of God. Firſt, in reſpect of the equity of the law of God, being this, that the Miniſters ought to live of the people, and to have ſufficient and competent meanes by them; for the Oxes mouth muſt not be muſled, he that ſerves muſt live of the Altar, and ſo of the Goſpell: which equity and ſubſtance of the law is morall and ought alwaies to continue.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe the lawes of the Land and of the Church, have confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this ancient conſtitution, (which in it ſelfe is different, the generall laid downe in the word, and the particular man hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed) &amp; ſo tithes may be ſaid to be by the law of God, becauſe they are by the law of man agreeable to the word, which lawes God hath commanded to obey. Thirdly, becauſe tithes have Beene dedicated to the Church and Miniſters, by men themſelves, and in that dedication there was neither error nor ſuperſtition. Therefore due, &amp; not to be taken away, no more then <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> might take away any part of that which they have vowed to the Church; onely, happily according to the rule of the law they may be redeemed, but not with leſſe, but with a thing of the ſame value, or rather according to the law, Deut. 27.31.</p>

                        <p>Now further I ſay, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that this maintenance is the moſt fit and competent, moſt equall and indifferent. Firſt, becauſe the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God in the beginning of the Church eſtabliſhed this, which was no meerely ceremoniall, but had a morall equity. Now how can they have an example of greater authority and more worthy to be followed? Againe, becauſe it affordeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent ſuſtainance for the one, when he ſhall live of the tenth and not of the twentieth or fifteenth part, which were too little, and not grieving and oppreſſing to the other, when he hath the nine parts reſerved to himſelfe.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe the Miniſters lives are ſubject to the ſame wants that other mens lives are; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it is fit and convenient that what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for themſelves, thereof, they ſhould affoord a part to him that laboureth in another great worke for them.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe 1 Tim. 3.2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> he muſt be given to hoſpitality, which ſhall be performed better of him, if he have things in their kinde, and ſo have his proviſion.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe when the Miniſter ſhouyd receive all good things for his maintenance and neceſſity, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and that, as Galat. 6.6. It might bee a preſent and palpable admonition to him, that hee alſo ſhould Miniſter in their wants, in ſpirituall things committed to his charge.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe that as the bleſſing of God was upon the people, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> their lands and labours, or denied to them, he alſo might be partaker of their aboundance and want; to abound with them, and to want with them; for where much, he was to receive much; and where little, the leſſe, alwaies proportionable to them, Num. 18.27. that out of this fellow ſeeking, he might praiſe God with them, or pray more earneſtly for them.</p>
                        <p>Now as for Cities where there are few or no things titheable, there the maintenance is and muſt be ſuch as the law hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, if it be ſufficient to maintaine a Miniſter, that laboureth amongſt them, in ſuch ſort as he may not be diſtracted with want or burdened with cares, or his Miniſtery diſgraced by his pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which if it be not, either by reaſon of his charge or the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the times, there ought to be an addition according to mens abilities; and in places where the law hath provided little or nothing, there are the people bound to provide their labourers their hire; not upon charity or almes, but as a matter of juſtice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that 1 Cor. 9.1. As he that goeth to warfare, may of duty and juſtice require his wages of thoſe for whom he fighteth; he that planteth a vineyard may of duty chalenge to eate thereof; or he who feedeth a flocke may of duty chalenge to eate the milke of the flocke. Then the Miniſter doing all theſe, may cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge his maintenance of duty, and they in juſtice are bound to give it him; yea part of their goods being due to the Lord as a
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:151759:243"/>homage or quit rent of all their goods, acknowledging that they hold and have all things they poſſeſſe and enjoy from him; and therefore owe all ſervice honour and obedience unto him. Now tſeeing he hath no need of theſe things himſelfe, but hath given hem to others, his Miniſters, by whom he will receive them, and communicate by them ſpirituall things alſo, not taking his own for nothing; theſe muſt know that though no law of man binde them, yet are they bound to give of their goods, and with ſome proportion of the tenth, for a better rule they cannot have, to the maintenance of the Miniſtery.</p>

                        <p>Men ought to give to God and to his Church and Miniſtery, his whole due and full right, to deale faithfully with him, and give all their tithsas, here; and all their honour, their double honour; 1. Tim. 5.15.16. and that wholly, not in part: ſo much is alſo inſinuated by that, Levit. 27.31.33. The Lord would not, that the Levites ſhould gaine out of other mens loſſes, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the people uſed to make a gaine craftily, by turning the tithe into money; he meeteth here with their deceit, leſt the Levite ſhould loſe any thing of his due; which is alſo the reaſon, that God would ſuffer no eprmutation or commutation fo the beaſt, or redemption: becauſe then nothing that was good ſhould have come to the Levites, no far or well fed beaſt; and ſo he ſhould not have had his due; becauſe they were ſo griping and covetous; and ſo their evill manners have brought forth a good law.

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> give him not all his due. It may be all the Law ties them to for maintenance, but nothing of that, the Apoſtle calls for honour, but if he be not a Miniſter juſt of their owne minds, that he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere not their conceit, as face anſweareth face in the water, they will hardly ſpeake ſo baſe of any man as of him, never reverence him at all: But many for maintenance do not give him the whole, though ſomewhat: for whereas in moſt places of the Land, all things ſhould be paied unto them in kinde, both by the law of God, and of the Land; they have ſought by all meanes, to alter the courſe, and have prevailed ſo far, as they have brought upon the Miniſters, a number of injurious cuſtomes of paying little or nothing, for that which is of Good value: And although at the firſt, this was not done without the indulgence of the Miniſter, yet many times it happeneth, that the Miniſter, either not able to ſue for his right, or not willing to diſadvantage his Miniſtery, by a perpetuall brawle, is forced to yield of his right, both for peace and hope, to do good: yet the peoples offence muſt needs be great, that they will not yield the things themſelves in kinde, or the value of them. And hence it comes to paſſe, that what the Miniſter hath of favour, once yielded unto, and for peace, they hold him thereby bound for ever, though the tithes and price of things do never ſo much alter. And againe, againſt all right they binde the ſucceſſor to the fact and fault of his predeceſſor, whereby in many things it comes to paſſe, that where a ſhilling is due, there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not a penny to the purſe of the Miniſter: As in many places, there is leſt to the Miniſter but two pence a Cow, by the yeare, and ſo much for an acre of meadow: yea in many places, nothing tith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, though men have never ſo great paſtures, and ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of ſheep, becauſe Abbey land, theſe fulfilling the iniquity of thoſe Fathers who then robbed the Church, for their owne bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. Of this ſort ſhould many in this City be, as the Miniſters do complaine, who bring not all their tith unto the Lord. But they could be content to pay them, if their Miniſter were as he ſhould be. I wonder what a kinde of man a Miniſter ſhould be, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:151759:247"/>one would thinke worthy of his tiths? for though to one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſome might be like them. Gal. 4.14.15. <hi>The triall of me which was in my fleſh, ye deſpiſed not, neither abhorred: but ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me as an Angel of God, yea, as Chriſt Ieſus. What was then year felicity? for I beare you record, that if it had been poſsible, you would have plucked out your owne eies, and have given them unto me.</hi> Who yet afterwards changed; ſo do they: But that which is due, is due, whatſoever he be, and howſoever he deale, or how worthy, or unworthy, they muſt deale faithfully: yet the unfaithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, muſt remember that he is ſubject to his judgement, who condemned the ſlothfull and unprofitable ſervant, and caſt him into utter darkneſſe.</p>

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> in bringing to him and his Miniſters, their whole due, all the tithes; and that not only ſo much as the law requires, but if that be too little, a full and competent and honeſt maintenance, according to their proportion beſides: And as to the poore, every man ought to give according to his abundance, ſo to the Miniſter; ſpecially when his charge and the times ſo require; elſe hath he not brought all his tithes to the Lord. But me thinks I heare ſome men an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, that too much is not good for a Miniſter, and many of them grow worſe by riches, idle, and proud, and negligent. And therefore as the Emperiour <hi>Frederick</hi> ſaid, <hi>de papa &amp; clericis,</hi> of the Pope and his cleargy,<note place="margin">Detrahamus illis nocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes divitias, hoc enim fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere opus eſt charitatis.</note> ſo ſay they,* <hi>Let us take from them the riches that do hurt them, for this is a worke of charity.</hi> I anſwer, I plead not for too much, but for a convenient maintenance; I commend them not, that are worſe by their abundance, yet are they men like others, and have the ſame infirmities, and too many of theſe objectors, though not to all, may I ſay: hypocrites, pull out the beame out of your owne eies; who more corrupt, careleſſe, and proud, then they by their abundance? Yet would they think it a bad concluſion, that they ſhould have their riches withheld from them. But doe they thinke the portion of tithes, and the like; too much for them? happily they are unequally divided by the law, let that be remedied, &amp; there will be found little enough. But is this to much? What think they of Gods proportion, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to his, not only tithes, but firſt fruit and offerings, which came to no ſmall matter? Beſides, as much land as the greateſt City came to, if the deſcription of Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> be true, who <hi>ad Dardanum</hi> ſaith, that the length from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba</hi> was 160. miles; the breadth from <hi>Ioppa</hi> to <hi>Bethleem,</hi> 46. miles. Now the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites portion of land was 48. Cities, Num. 35.7. every City had in Suburbs, 2000. Cubites from the wall round, verſe 5. which wil afford a large portion to the Levites of this land. And is it too much now for the Miniſters to have proportionable tenths, and a little glebe? But let theſe men take heed, leſt the love of the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:151759:247"/>world, and the deceitfulnes of riches, have not excluded the love of God our Saviour, as Joh. and the care of his worſhip and honour, and leſt the envy and diſdaine, which uſually is in the world, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Miniſtery be in them, when they think nothing enough for themſelvs, to have and joyne houſe to houſe, and land to land, till they dwell as Princes of the earth alone; but if any portion be allotted to the ſervants of God, as a reward not only of their former ſtudies, but alſo of their preſent labours, it is thought too much; and of them who will give the Lawiers free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the maintenance of their titles, and often but quarrels; nd to the Phyſitian a large fee for taking care of their bodies; but the Miniſter a ſmall pittance, for the ſaving of their ſoules: which of many, make men feare, they never reaped ſpirituall things by us, though they heare us often, becauſe they never part with any temporall things to them, or not without grudging and repining, or but in a marvelous ſlacke and pinching meaſure. The man who hath received health by his Phyſitian, and right by his Lawier, will give him both his fee, and reverence; if not, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him but ſlenderly; So in this: And ſo men ſtop their eares to this of the Prophet; yet for all this, thinke I it not tolerable, that a Miniſter ſhould neglect the care of his flocke, while he hath charge of them, but ſtrive to do it, becauſe, 1. Cor. 9.16.17. <hi>Though I preach the Goſpell, I have nothing to rejoyce of: for neceſsitie is laid upon me, and wo is unto me, if I preach not the Goſpell: for if I do it willingly, I have a reward: but if I do it againſt my will, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the diſpenſation is committed to me.</hi> For this will not be a plea for the Miniſter, at Chriſts judgement ſeat, when he muſt give an account how he fed the flocke of Chriſt: It may be a plea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them to condemne them, not acquit him. Therefore ſhould it not be ſo, that though they keep him poore, which is their ſin, he ſhould ſhut peace out of his owne heart, which would not be, if he laboured painfully, and looked to the Lord for his reward. And to ſay to his flocke, as Saint <hi>Auguſt.</hi> to his, <hi>in Pſal.</hi> 146. <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimas vis,</hi> will you make choiſe to pay tithes? Then let that be my portion.

And to make way for this, hee deprived the people of the worſhip of God, and turned the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of religion into a dumbe and ridiculous ſpectacle; which done, it was thought convenient that to be a Prieſt, required no gifts, but that every common man might eaſily undergoe the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of it; for if the gifts of learning had ſtill remained as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, the maintenane that belongeth unto them, could under no colour have beene taken away; but when every one that was able to read his Portuiſe was thought ſufficiently fruniſhed to that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, it eaſily followed that the living given to the Church for the edification thereof, was thought too much for ſo meane a man in ſo baſe a labour.

Acts 2.38. Muſt not theſe then tempt God and not try him? had not Chriſt tempted him when there was an ordinary way, if hee had taken the extraordinary at the ſuggeſtion of Satan, becauſe of Gods promiſe? ſhould not they tempt him, if when they ſhould paſſe over the water, upon ſome mans ſuggeſtion they ſhould refuſe the bridge or boate and leape into the water, becauſe he hath promiſed to give his Angels, &amp;c. It will be granted; yet becauſe the Lord hath appointed an ordinary, and the promiſe is onely in their wayes; that is, doing that he hath commanded. Is it not then ſo in this? And if in thoſe kindes they can looke for no performance of his faithfulneſſe, why in this? but that they are deluded by Santan and their corruption, and as fooles led to the ſtockes, and as oxen to the ſlaughter.</p>

If the Prince be offended to ſee one of his common ſouldiers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced, and pinched of their wages; if one of his Guard and nigh attendance, wherein the ſafety of his perſon conſiſteth, his anger would exceedingly be kindled; but if his ſonne, ſaith <hi>Cyril,</hi> I would apply it, if himſelfe, his owne homage and tribute denyed him, would he honour ſuch?</p>

For what if they cannot ſee God, how he doth it, yet ſeeing they ſee it is done, and the world and all things in it governed after a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous manner, they ought to beleeve it is ſo?

Or as <hi>Gregory Nazi anzen:</hi> If thou heare a Harp ſound of divers ſtrings, and all keep one harmony, thou wilt conceive of one that ſtrikes them, though thou ſee him not: ſo in the government of the world. Yea, when they cannot ſee the reaſon of things that are done, yet men ought to admire the wiſedome of God.

For as a dreame commeth by the multitude of buſineſſe, ſo the voyce of a foole is in the multitude of words. When thou haſt vowed a vow to God, deferre not to pay it; for he delighteth not in fooles, pay therefore that thou haſt vowed, for in the multitude of dreames, and vanities, are alſo many words but feare thou God.

But God doth regard the words of the tongue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath made a law as wel for the words as deeds. God made the tongue, and therefore will have the fruit, 1 Cor. 6.20. For ye are bought for a price; therefore glorifie God in your body, and in your ſpirit, for they are Gods, ſo with tongue as well as hand; and therefore we muſt looke to give account of words, as well as of our actions: Matth. 12.36. <hi>But I ſay unto you, that of every idle word that men ſhall ſpeake, they ſhall give account thereof at the day of judgement</hi> Jude verſes 14.15. <hi>And Enoch alſo, the ſeaventh from Adam, propheſied of ſuch, ſaying, behold the Lord commeth with thouſands of his Saints, to give judgement againſt all men, and to rebuke all the ungodly among them, of all their wicked deeds, which they have ungodly committed and of all their cruell ſpeakings, which wicked ſinners have ſpoken againſt him.

But we ſay, As Jam. 1.26. his religion is vaine, no religion though he do the workes of religion, which hath not juſtice and mercy and love joined with it: ſo we ſay his righteouſneſſe is vaine, which hath not the workes of religion with it: we ſee a man hear the word, receive the ſacrament, be diligent in the works of Gods worſhip, but he is unjuſt, covetous, unchaſt, &amp;c. we ſay his religion is in vain: and this will every one ſubſcribe to; we ſee men juſt, and chaſt, and liberall in almes, &amp;c. but he is irreligious, he regards not Gods day, he neglects the word, the ſacrament, prayer, and ſuch like: we ſay his righteouſneſſe is vaine. But this will not all ſubſcribe to; but they ſhall know it at one time or other, that it is in vaine; not onely ſo farre as <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> ſpeakes of workes without faith, comparing them with the reliques of the dead<note n="*" place="margin">Cadavera enim etſi &amp;c. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi>
                           </note> carcaſes, though they be covered with pretious and rich cloaths, yet have no heate for them: ſo ſuch as want faith, though they ſhine with glorious workes, yet they do them no good: now where there is not knowledge nor conſcience of religion, there cannot be faith. But further <hi>Orig.</hi> in Job goes.<note n="*" place="margin">Omnia quae faciant homines, &amp;c. <hi>Orig.</hi>
                           </note> All things which men doe, whether in keeping their virginity, or in abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, or in the chaſtnes of their bodies, or in the mortifying of the fleſh, or in the diſtributing of their goods, they are all to no purpoſe, and to their loſſe, if they do them not of faith.

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:151759:269"/>himſelfe. For if the Apoſtles rule be good, Jam. 2.26. faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works is dead: then why not much more, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſt,</hi> are works without faith? which works muſt needs be where there is not religion: and ſo he ſhall not have his reward that doth them, but they will be unprofitable to him; for as he that builds without a foundation loſeth his worke, and hath only his labour, travaile, and griefe; ſo is he that would build up works of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, without faith and religion. <hi>Orig.</hi> And as he ſaith, all the whole year that <hi>Noah</hi> was preſerved in the Arke, and the Sun ſhewed not her ſelfe, nor ſent her beames upon the earth, the earth gave no fruit, for without the Sun it can bring forth no fruit; So unleſſe the truth of God ſhine in the hearts of men, they can bring forth no fruit of good works or righteouſneſſe. Then muſt every one endeavour that is juſt, upright, chaſt, &amp;c. not to reſt there, but labour to be religious, and have knowledge and faith which muſt ſanctifie and make acceptable, and ſo profitable to the other, as the Temple the gold, and the Altar the offering: leſt they be to us as <hi>Ciprian ſer. dezelo &amp; livore,</hi> or rather as the ſpirit of God ſaith, Rom. 14.23. <hi>Sin, becauſe not of faith.</hi>

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:151759:273"/>to be profitable to the faithfull, becauſe it frees a man from the danger of ſinning, and puts him into a ſecurity of not ſinning,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> So that in bringing death, is by death deſtroyed, as the viper of her brood. Death had never entred but by ſin, and ſin had never ended but by death, Fourthly they are freed from the aſſaults of Satan and the world; for they by it doe not only flie into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe to be free <hi>for many daies,</hi> as the Church, Rev. 12.6. but as the words are in the fifth verſe, <hi>they are caught up unto God, and to his throne:</hi> and ſo as favourites purſued, are ſafe when they are in the Court, ſpecially in the preſence chamber: So much more here. Beſides theſe freedomes, it brings great benefits. Firſt, it is their paſſage into the preſence of God, where is fulneſſe of joy; an unpleaſant gate, but to a Princely Pallace. Secondly, it is an herald that fetches them to their glory and crowning, from theſe earthly cottages, 2 Cor. 5.1. Thirdly, it reſtores our bodies more holy and pure unto us. <hi>At length then what is death? Tis no more then to put off ones coate; the body is as a garment, and we lay it off but for a while by death, to put it on againe a freſh.</hi>

                        <p>The Papiſts underſtand this of the true <hi>Eliah,</hi> and that he ſhall come againe in perſon. <hi>Ribera</hi> hath three reaſons for it. Firſt, The authority of <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Riber in Lo.</note> 
                           <hi>Aug. Ambr. Theod. Cyril. Aquin. &amp;c.</hi> We anſwer, one Angel is more then all theſe, eſpecially Chriſt who is our ſole Doctor, and hath otherwiſe interpreted. Secondly, The <hi>Septuagint.</hi> in ſtead of Prophet reads <hi>Thesbite.</hi> We anſwer that the originall is Prophet, ſo <hi>Ribera</hi> himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, and ſo the <hi>King of Spains Bible</hi> hath it. Muſt we then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the Fountaine by the Chanell, or this by that? Thirdly, His third reaſon is from the laſt words of the verſe, <hi>Leſt I come, &amp;c.</hi> which are, he ſaith, underſtood of the ſecond comming of Chriſt, becauſe his firſt comming was to ſave, not to judge or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy. I anſwer, It is not Chriſt that ſpeakes theſe words, but the Father, who verſe three, was called <hi>The Lord of Hoſts,</hi> a title not given to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And the words are not meant, of the deſtruction of the wicked at the laſt judgement, but of Gods plaguing them in this life, for contemning of Chriſt, as their owne <hi>Montanus</hi>
                           <pb n="285" facs="tcp:151759:276"/>doth alſo interpret it: <hi>Bellarm ine</hi> alſo would prove it as <hi>Ribera</hi> doth, that the words referre to Chriſts ſecond comming, becauſe that day is called <hi>Great and fearfull,</hi> whereas Chriſts firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming is acceptable, and a day of ſalvation. I anſwer, that Chriſts ſecond comming, in reſpect of no other thing, nor to any other perſons, is great and fearefull, then his firſt comming is, and? <hi>contra,</hi> for his ſecond comming, to his owne, is a day of ſalvation, and they are bid to lift up their heads when it approaches: but to the wicked, both the firſt and ſecond comming are fearfull, and full of horror. Therefore <hi>Montanus</hi> interprets it thus: the day is great in reſpect of the good, &amp; dreadfull in reſpect of the wicked; reſembling this place to that of <hi>Iohn,</hi> Matth. 3.12.</p>
                        <p>But the reaſon why the Papiſts contend it ſhould be the true <hi>Eliah,</hi> is, becauſe they might prove that the Pope is not Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. This is one of <hi>Sanders</hi> his great demonſtrations to prove it, becauſe <hi>Eliah</hi> muſt reſiſt Antichriſt, but <hi>Eliah</hi> is not yet come to do it. <hi>ergo,</hi> But what Prophet, what Apoſtle, what Scripture, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver told them any ſuch thing. Papall traditions will leave nothing unknowne, they tell us things wherein Gods ſpirit is ſilent; they tell us the ſouldiers name who pierced Chriſt, the theeves name who were crucified with Chriſt, the hoſts name in whoſe houſe he celebrated the ſupper, and the names of the two witneſſes, Rev. 11.3. to the <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> if we will believe them: but their folly is made manifeſt to all that will ſee.</p>

                           <hi>Before the comming &amp;c.]</hi> Here is the time when <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall come, immediatly before Chriſts comming; that is, his firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, which though it may ſeem to be deſcribed contrary, when it is ſaid to be acceptable and gracious, yet this is ſpoken in reſpect of divers parties: that whereas there were ſome that contemned and made no account of the mercies of Chriſt, to them it ſhould be a dreadfull day, but to the godly, acceptable and gracious.</p>
                        <p>The comming of Chriſt is very terrible, to all naturall, <label type="milestone">

It was a commendable practiſe of the <hi>Iewes</hi> to give their children the names of ſuch as had formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celd in vertue, (a cuſtome imitated by Chriſtians who uſed to call ſuch children, as were borne to them upon or neare the feſtivalls of any of the Apoſtles or others, by their names, which cuſtome <hi>Philip Pareus</hi> in the life of his father <hi>David Pareus,</hi> tells us was obſerved in his country, and that, for that reaſon his Father had that name given him) or for the remembrance of ſome event, or for the foretelling of ſome thing to come to paſſe; But however, uſually they gave them names of a good ſignification.

                  <p>Who the Father of <hi>Malachy</hi> was we finde not, and yet that his Father was not a prophet is not to be concluded, for that rule of latter Hebrewes, That ſuch Prophets whoſe Fathers are named were the ſonnes of Prophets, and otherwiſe not; Is found to bee uncertaine by <hi>Burgenſis</hi> in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1. and by <hi>Franc.

                  <p>The place alſo of his birth is as uncertaine, ſave that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and out of him <hi>Ribera, praelud.</hi> 5. tell us it was <hi>Sopha</hi> a Towne of <hi>Zabulon,</hi> A place not at all mentioned or obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>Euſebius</hi> or S. <hi>Hierom</hi> in <hi>Bonfrerius</hi> his <hi>Onomaſticon,</hi> nor by M. <hi>Iohn More</hi> in his exact map of the Land.</p>

Abraham bar dior,</hi> as <hi>Buxtorfius</hi> names him in <hi>Bibliotheca Rabbinica, litera</hi> P.) yet nearer to the yeare of <hi>Iſaackson,</hi> and our commentary, about A. M. 3450. Let ſuch as have leaſure, and thinke it worth the time, ſatisfy themſelves farther; to me it is plaine by the matter that he handles, that he prophecyed after the Temple was built (for he reproves their profaning of the Altar) and a little before the comming of <hi>Ezra,</hi> for he inveighed againſt their marrying with ſtrangers, which <hi>Ezra</hi> by his authority did remedy. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> tells us hee was borne after the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and dyed young. As if he had beene an Angel, onely came and told his errand and preſently returned.

They ſaw the Sacrificing to be deſpiſed; ſleighted through ſuch long diſ-uſe; by reaſon of the 70 yeares Captivity they had not recovered the fervour of former time to be ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the Lord: or, 2. They look't ſo ornefully on the meane building and ornaments of the Temple, for it did not anſwer the glory of the former houſe; So <hi>Tarnovius:</hi> or, 3. Becauſe the <hi>Iewes</hi> were newly returned and were yet but poore, and could not bring ſuch rich oblations, therefore the Prieſts grew cold and careleſſe in attending on the altar: or, 4. Becauſe they ſaw what was brought conſumed with fire, they thought any thing good enough for the fire, good enough to be burnt. The truth is, The low and cheape opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Gods worſhip, hath ever made a greater waſte upon religion, than an over-high; and there is leſſe danger (though there be danger) in ſuperſtition then in profaneneſſe. Hence it was that the piety of ancient Chriſtian times was ſo much in their reverent demeanour in Gods houſe, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their devotion had much faeculentie and droſſe admixt. Among the many <hi>Canons</hi> to this purpoſe of other Churches, and our owne, every where obvious, I cannot but here inſert that very devout one which fell into my obſervation at the time of the collecting of theſe notes, which Sir <hi>Hen.

                        <hi>Tumults, and Vaine talkings, and all other like actions, let them by no meanes be ſuffered in that holy place. For there where Gods Name is called upon, and Sacrifice of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto God, and where no doubt the Angels are frequent, it is dangerous to doe or ſay any ſuch thing as agrees not to that holy place. For if the Lord caſt thoſe out of the Temple which bought or ſold ſuch victimes as were to be offered to himſelfe; how much more offended will he caſt out them who pollute that place ſet apart, for divine worſhip, with vaine leaſings, mirthes, and ſuch like toyes.</hi> The place is, <hi>Inter Capitula incertae editionis, Cap,</hi> 10. <hi>In Concil.

                        <hi>Covering the Altar of the Lord with teares]</hi> The <hi>Geneva</hi> note is, <hi>yee cauſe the people to lament, becauſe God doth not regard their ſacrifices, ſo that they ſeeme to ſacrifice in vaine.</hi> So referring this to the former conteſtations with the Prieſts, An expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſingular, and wide of the whole preſent context, and the matter that the Prophet hath in hand. That of <hi>Lyrant:</hi> alſo ſeemes to miſſe the ſenſe, you continuing in your ſinne goe to the Altar, and weepe there to beg pardon, but in vaine. That of S <hi>Hierom, Cyril, Theodoret,</hi> and which out comment. followes, is more agreeable; you ſo vilely uſe your other former wives, that they fly, or you cauſe them to fly, to the temple, and weepe before the Altar. See <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.18. and 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.6.10. which texts will give light to this. But for the phraſe, <hi>To cover the Altar with teares;</hi> It is, either to weepe plentifully, or to weepe over the Altar: to throw themſelves blubbered and ſwolne with teares upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, even embracing it as it were; which was alſo the uſe of other Nations, in <hi>Their calamities, ſolemne othes,</hi> and <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications,</hi> to lay hold on the Altars. So <hi>Arſinoe</hi> in her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame calamity and ſuſpition of her brother <hi>Ptolomies</hi> fraud and cruelties, cauſes him to come and lay hold on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars in the holyeſt Temple in <hi>Macedon,</hi> for her further aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance and ſafety when ſhee received his oath.

                     <p>Upon this neceſſity of laying hold upon the altars when they addreſſed themſelves to the Deity, <hi>Robert Stephanus</hi> in his <hi>Theſaurus</hi> alleadge <hi>Varro,</hi> that the old Latine word for Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars was <hi>Anſae</hi> (the eares or handles of a pot) and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward changed into <hi>Arae.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Altar of the Lord]</hi> This is an amplifying of their grieſe. Their injury was extreame, that they are driven to the laſt refuge; men repaire unto the Altar when all helpe failes. And further, at the Altar they ſhould rejoyce before the Lord as the cuſtome was when they came up with their wives to the Temple, 1 <hi>Sam,</hi> 1. yet there, even there they are
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:151759:315"/>cauſed to weepe. Tis called, the altar of the Lord, It is his ſtanding place, the ordinary reſidence of God where theſe diſtreſſed women were confident to finde him and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine themſelves to him: that is, more ſolemnly, and for a publique witneſſe of their miſerie; for elſe God who is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where doth every where obſerve the teares of them that are oppreſſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>With teares, with weeping, and with crying out.</hi> Severall words are uſed for the farther amplification of their griefe. They wept, yea they roared out, and made great clamour and noyſe, or ſent out deep groanes, ſo the word is tranſlated <hi>Ierem.</hi> 51.52.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the ſecond aggravation of their ſinne is, that thereby they did alſo hurt themſelves in that they made their owne offerings not to bee accepted. <hi>Inſomuch that here gardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth it with good will at your hand.</hi>] The teares and groanes of your wives move God more then your ſacrifices doe; ſo that he regards them not, hee will not lookeat them, or turne his face towards them. The adverb of denying is not here in the latter mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but it is to bee repeated <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Thirdly, the third aggravation of this ſinne, is in <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, 15. That it is againſt the Ordinance of God. Where ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,

A better ſenſe then that of <hi>A la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pide,</hi> but for which he is faine to take his farewell of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized <hi>Vulgar</hi> tranſlation. If thou put her away, give her ſome part of thy garments to cover her, ſomething to live on; So <hi>Luther</hi> occaſionally expounds it: which ſenſe <hi>Oſian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> followes, give her a good dowry, that if ſhe be put away ſhee may marry another.
