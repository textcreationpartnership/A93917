            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>After he hath commended him for his <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weariable induÅ¿try</hi> and <hi>Å¿ingular proficiency</hi> in his owne, and his <hi>abilitie</hi> and <hi>willingneÅ¿Å¿e</hi> to bee helpefull to others <hi>Studies,</hi> even while hee was young in the <hi>Colledge;</hi> Hee deÅ¿cends to the conÅ¿ideration of him in his publique cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, That he proved <hi>a painefull, a faithfull MiniÅ¿ter of ChriÅ¿t, a skilfull, a powerfull diÅ¿pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿er of Gods word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The proofes of which were, his conÅ¿tant and inceÅ¿Å¿ant imployments in <hi>Preaching</hi> twice every Sabbath for many yeeres; beÅ¿ides his <hi>CatechiÅ¿ing</hi> the younger Å¿ort in the week days, (which he did with notable diÅ¿cretion, the males and females apart, the riper and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder
<pb facs="tcp:151759:12"/>in the preÅ¿ence of the ruder and rawer, and then the rawer by themÅ¿elves; together with other offices of his PaÅ¿torall function, privatly performed.</p>
                  <p>Which <hi>MiniÅ¿tery</hi> of his was very effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, Å¿o that beÅ¿ides many other ChriÅ¿tian Souls converted by him (in which Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e few MiniÅ¿ters were to bee compared with him) many faithfull MiniÅ¿ters alÅ¿o received their firÅ¿t beginnings of light and Å¿pirituall life and grace, from his MiniÅ¿tery; So that he did not only winne many Å¿oules, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny winners of Souls.</p>
                  <p>ThoÅ¿e two things which make a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat man, had an happy conjunction in him, namely <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Judgement.</hi> The proofes of which were, both the deÅ¿ire that many had to uÅ¿e him for the overÅ¿ight of their laÅ¿t Wils, and for the diÅ¿poÅ¿ing of their eÅ¿tates; And that Å¿o many reverend MiniÅ¿ters from all parts of the <hi>Realme</hi> did by Letters or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e uÅ¿ually Å¿eeke to him for the reÅ¿olution of their doubts.</p>
                  <p>As theÅ¿e made him a <hi>Compleat man,</hi> Å¿o he had that which made him a <hi>Compleat Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter,</hi> namely, <hi>That he could Å¿peake his mind fitly,</hi> and <hi>That he durÅ¿t Å¿peake it freely.</hi> For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, his ability to expreÅ¿Å¿e himÅ¿elfe, <hi>with cleare Method, Å¿ound proofes, choiÅ¿e words, fit
<pb facs="tcp:151759:12"/>phraÅ¿e, pregnant Å¿imilitudes, plentifull illuÅ¿trati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, pithy perÅ¿waÅ¿ions, Å¿weet inÅ¿inuations, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full inforcements, allegations of antiquitie, and varietie of good literature;</hi> he was Å¿uch an one as many Å¿trove to imitate, not many of them matched. For the other, his <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Å¿peech</hi> in reproving of Å¿inne even to the faces of the greateÅ¿t, many are able to teÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, and Å¿ome accidents made it more publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne, then his deÅ¿ire was it Å¿hould have been.</p>
                  <p>Among other particular commendations of him, One was his zealous and earneÅ¿t pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿uit of reformation of Å¿ome prophanations of the Sabbath, wherein he prevailed alÅ¿o for the alteration of Å¿ome things in that kind offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ive, as well with the maine body of the City, as with Å¿ome particular <hi>Societies.</hi> Another was his pious care &amp; diligence in the religious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truction and education of thoÅ¿e that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his private charge, children and others.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>IÅ¿raelites</hi> provoked to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and heavy diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure by their Å¿innes the Monarch of the whole world: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he being thus diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed, Å¿ent againÅ¿t them <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> who tooke them, and carried the King, his Princes and the whole people into <hi>Babel,</hi> after that he had Å¿poyled their Å¿tately Temple, deÅ¿troy'd their Å¿trong Walls, and laid waÅ¿te <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> it Å¿elfe; where they endured <hi>70.</hi> yeares exile and baniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which yeares expired, they were againe brought to their Countrey, when and where better things were expected from them, both in way of thankefulneÅ¿Å¿e, and in remembrance of their former Captivity, leÅ¿t a worÅ¿e thing Å¿hould afterwards befall them. But they forgetfull of former things, both beatings &amp; benefits, as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are, returned to their Å¿innes, polluted the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worÅ¿hip, gave themÅ¿elves to divers vices, began to make marriages with Infidels, againe embraced Polygamy, took up the cuÅ¿tome of giving bills of divorce, committed Å¿acriledges, caÅ¿t out Å¿trange contempts againÅ¿t God, and blaÅ¿phemies: By all which the Lord being againe provoked,
<pb facs="tcp:151759:14"/>Å¿ent the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> to reprove them Å¿harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to threaten them Å¿everely with certaine new judgments, and to the impenitent certaine &amp; finall deÅ¿truction; yet in the meane time cheering up the good with comforts, provoking them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, perÅ¿wading them to faith in ChriÅ¿t, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freÅ¿hing them with many Å¿weet promiÅ¿es.</p>
                  <p>Now it is no hard thing to make the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, and apply theÅ¿e things to our times, that it may appeare, the handling of this is no unfit thing, but apt to the time.</p>
                  <p>For the Å¿innes of the Land God was diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed, and gave over the people to captivity (though in their owne Land Å¿omewhat leÅ¿Å¿e than this, yet it was) both of body and Å¿oule to a new <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar,</hi> which makes it the greater, the Church and Å¿pirituall <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> much defaced, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of it partly put to flight, partly to the fire. But Å¿ee how good God was, after a time he brought againe our Captivity. After which he looked for better things from us, and haply had them while the benefit was freÅ¿h, and the bondage yet felt. But Å¿ee, theÅ¿e are worne out of minde, and we againe have committed great Å¿ins againÅ¿t God, by which we juÅ¿tly have provoked Gods indignation againÅ¿t us, yea and alas, we ceaÅ¿e not to provoke it; for how great contempt of the Å¿ervice of God is there in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very place? what prophaneneÅ¿Å¿e? what corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of manners? what unfaithfulneÅ¿Å¿e in covenant breaking? what uncleaneneÅ¿Å¿e in marriage? what
<pb facs="tcp:151759:14"/>horrible oaths? what fearefull perjuries? what execrable blaÅ¿phemies againÅ¿t the HigheÅ¿t? not in meane perÅ¿ons, but of the higheÅ¿t rankes; not in Countries only, but in famous Cities; not in meane mens Cottages onely, but in noble mens places and Palaces, in Church and Common-wealth: Å¿o that the Lord may Å¿ay to us, as he Å¿aid to <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachy,</hi> Chap. <hi>16.</hi> becauÅ¿e neither honour nor feare be performed to him. So that not onely juÅ¿t are thoÅ¿e plagues that are come upon us, peÅ¿tilence to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy now almoÅ¿t three yeares, and famine to the Å¿oule begun, and threatned more, but alÅ¿o particular &amp; generall judgments. WhatÅ¿oever is in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheÅ¿ie, may juÅ¿tly both be threatned and executed upon us; when it is juÅ¿t with God, where like Å¿ins are, to bring upon them like puniÅ¿hments.</p>

In common Å¿ence, if any have halfe an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth weight laid upon his hand, or foot, and preÅ¿Å¿ing him Å¿ore, and he feele it not, what judgment is to be given of it, but to be a mortified and a dead member? Å¿o alas, how many dead men are in our times and daies? The burden not of the Word onely, but of the rod of the Lord, not threatned, but executed, hath beene upon our Land and Church by the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Plague; now well towards three yeares wee have walked in the land of the dead, we have beene in the houÅ¿e of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:151759:17"/>Indeed the living hath laid it to his heart, but Å¿o few have done it, that the dead are more than the living; not onely our wanton women, and voluptuous men, to whom that 1 Tim. 5.6. <hi>They are dead while they live:</hi> but our worldly men, our ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and others all dead, for this they have not felt. We Å¿orrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for fifty &amp; odde thouÅ¿ands that dyed in the former yeare; we have as much need to Å¿orrow for Å¿o many thouÅ¿ands yet living, and dead amongÅ¿t us; they never indeed felt, nor yet doe feele this burden: Their irreligious carriage when it was here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t us, both at home &amp; abroad, in the City and abroad, their Å¿mall conformity Å¿ince to the Law of God, little reforming of their corruptions, nay, their monÅ¿trous deformity in themÅ¿elves, wives, and children, perÅ¿wades my heart, as 'tis PÅ¿al. 36.1. <hi>The tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion of the wicked Å¿aith within my heart, there is no feare of God before my eyes:</hi> Å¿o that they had no feeling of this at all; for they who truely felt it, would grow Å¿omewhat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if not altogether reformed. If an heatheniÅ¿h people, who knew not God, at the burden of the Word of the Lord did Å¿o humble themÅ¿elves, that the Lord Å¿aid, <hi>Jonah</hi> 8.10. <hi>He repented of the evill he Å¿aid he would doe to you, and did it not;</hi> what Å¿hall be thought of ChriÅ¿tian men by profeÅ¿Å¿ion, living in the Church of God, if at the burden of his Word they repent not, nor depart from their evill wayes? but IÅ¿aiah 8.8. <hi>Though they be Å¿tricken, revolt more and more:</hi> it is becauÅ¿e they are dead men, and cannot feele it. Oh then weepe not for me, but for your Å¿elves, and children, as thoÅ¿e not for the departed, but for the living dead: for if it be true, The beginning of the remedy is the Å¿ence and acknowledgment of the malady; how farre are they from cure that have not yet the feeling of it? I feared the Plague by a naturall infirmity, though God enabled me to abide upon my calling in the hotteÅ¿t brunt of it, and mercifully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erved me hitherto to his Church, and to Å¿peake this to you this day. But if it Å¿hould now come by the providence of God upon me, that he beginnes to threaten it to the City, I Å¿hould willingly embrace it, as thinking God to be marvellous merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto me, and whoÅ¿oever he Å¿hould Å¿mite by it, to take it thus into his owne hand, and not to leave us to more fearefull judgments, which I cannot Å¿ay, but I marvellouÅ¿ly feare, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at the doore to the wakening of dead men and women, or the Å¿weeping of them away. I am no Prophet, I pray God my words be no prophecy; but what peace, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>This ought to teach men in affliction, if a judgment come, and impoÅ¿ed by the hand of God, to beare it patiently and meekely, as <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 15.25, 26. for it is a burden. The way to be eaÅ¿ed, is not Å¿trugling with it, but meekely to beare it; for a priÅ¿oner to be free from his fetters, is not in the Jaylors
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151759:17"/>Å¿ight to Å¿eeke to breake them, or to file them off; that is the way to procure more, or the longer lying in them: So, to be eaÅ¿ed of a burden, is not to wreÅ¿tle with it when one is under it, but to goe Å¿oftly; there is more eaÅ¿e while it is on his back, and Å¿ooner comes he to be releaÅ¿ed of it. A man may with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiency wreÅ¿tle and uÅ¿e unlawfull meanes to eaÅ¿e himÅ¿elfe, and God happly will let them proÅ¿per for a while; but after he will bring a more heavy and inevitable burden on him, that with his former Å¿hifts Å¿hall make more heavy to him. There is a fable, but it hath his Morall for this purpoÅ¿e; A certaine AÅ¿Å¿e laded with Salt, fell into a river, and after he had riÅ¿en, found his burthen lighter, for the moiÅ¿ture made it melt away; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he would ever after lye him downe in the water as he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with his burthen, and Å¿o eaÅ¿e himÅ¿elfe: His owner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his craft, after laded him as heavy with Wooll; the AÅ¿Å¿e purpoÅ¿ing to eaÅ¿e himÅ¿elfe, as before, laid himÅ¿elfe downe in the next water, and thinking to have eaÅ¿e, riÅ¿ing againe to feele his weight, found it heavier, as it continued with him all the day. The Morall is, that they who impatiently Å¿eeke meanes contrary to the will of God, to eaÅ¿e themÅ¿elves of their burden, Å¿hall have it more and more encreaÅ¿e upon them.</p>
                        <p>That men Å¿hould make a Å¿peciall reÅ¿traint to themÅ¿elves to keepe from Å¿inning, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Æ²Å¿e </seg>3</label> becauÅ¿e an heavy and grievous burden elÅ¿e is ready to be laid upon their Å¿houlders. Sinne it Å¿elfe is an heavy burden, but few feele it, and fewer feare it; but to this burden Å¿hall the burden of puniÅ¿hment be added; and who is Å¿ufficient for theÅ¿e things? if the firÅ¿t burden feare them not, becauÅ¿e there is Å¿ome pleaÅ¿ure in Å¿inne to the fleÅ¿h, yet let the Å¿econd, which hath no pleaÅ¿ure at all. When thou art tempted to Å¿inne, by which thou muÅ¿t needs tempt and provoke God, learne to caÅ¿t thy accompts well, conÅ¿ult if thou bee able to meete him that comes againÅ¿t thee, Luke 14. Å¿o, if thou bee'Å¿t able to meete him, and beare his burden, goe on, and Å¿pare not; delight in all thy wayes, reÅ¿traine thy Å¿elfe from no Å¿inne: but if not, if we may invert and reÅ¿olve, <hi>Doe we provoke the Lord to jealouÅ¿ie? are we Å¿tronger than he?</hi> 1 Cor. 20.22. then let this reÅ¿traine us, if nothing elÅ¿e will; let us imitate Porters, who called, and offered money to beare a burden, will poiÅ¿e and weigh the burden in their hands firÅ¿t, which when they Å¿ee they are not able to beare, no gaine will entice them; Å¿o in this caÅ¿e let us doe.</p>

Sometime when Prophets were more frequent and perpetuall in the Church, and God Å¿poke to them by dreames, or by viÅ¿ions, and apparitions, they had divers kinds of words, and had liberty for divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Å¿peaking and delivery: But our Prophet was Å¿uch a meÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿enger, that the Commandement hee had received, and was credited with, he muÅ¿t deliver in Å¿o many words, and the Å¿ame he received them in, and Å¿o he doth; for in the whole he never uÅ¿eth his owne perÅ¿on, but the Lord onely, as Chap. 1.2. and 2.1. and 3.1. and 4.1.</p>

                           <hi>I have loved you,]</hi> A Å¿peech Å¿poken with affection, Å¿pecially by valuing his love, and diÅ¿daining to have it Å¿o neglected of thoÅ¿e upon whom he had beÅ¿towed it.

                        <p>Love given to God, Å¿ignifies not a paÅ¿Å¿ion nor affection, for there is no Å¿uch thing in God. <hi>Ira Dei non perturbatio animi e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus, Å¿ed judicium quo irrogatur poena peccato.

So of this, it is no paÅ¿Å¿ion, but his free election to beÅ¿tow, yea, an actuall gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to them the adoption of Å¿onnes and eternall life. For God is Å¿aid to be angry, when he doth that which commonly men doe when they are angry; and to love, when he doth that which men doe when they love. Now this cannot be underÅ¿tood of his generall love, of which all are partakers, men and Angels, bleÅ¿Å¿ing, preÅ¿erving, Å¿uÅ¿taining them: for then were it no great matter that he affirmes here to his. But of a Å¿peciall love, that is, his chooÅ¿ing of them to be Å¿onnes, and to beÅ¿tow on them eternall life. I have loved you, that is, I have choÅ¿en you to be my people, and I will be your God; to be my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and I will be your Father, and to give you the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Å¿onnes, than which what can be greater? <hi>Hierome</hi>
                           <pb n="16" facs="tcp:151759:23"/>thinkes he denies now to love them, becauÅ¿e he uÅ¿eth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-tenÅ¿e. But it is no rule, when as the pretertenÅ¿e doth often include the preÅ¿ent, Rom. 1.24. PÅ¿al. 1.1.</p>
                        <p>The firÅ¿t Å¿inne reproved is unthankfulneÅ¿Å¿e, the reproofe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing covertly inÅ¿inuated, rather than openly Å¿et downe, under the recording and recalling of Gods love and the fruits of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they had beene partakers. <hi>Hierome</hi> obÅ¿erveth here, leÅ¿t the puniÅ¿hment Å¿hould Å¿eeme unjuÅ¿t, and God Å¿hould without cauÅ¿e afflict them, and lay the burden upon them, he addeth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of their Å¿innes.

Ingratitude and unthankfulneÅ¿Å¿e unto God for his love, and the fruits of it, the bleÅ¿Å¿ings men receive, either Å¿pirituall or temporall, is a very great Å¿inne. So the Lord Å¿hews it here by his Prophet, when he puts it in the foremoÅ¿t of all other Å¿innes in this people, and as the principall which makes him threaten this burden unto them. So <hi>IÅ¿aiah</hi> 1.2. Å¿ets it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other Å¿innes. It is by the ApoÅ¿tle put among the Å¿innes of the laÅ¿t dayes, when iniquity Å¿hall get the upper hand, and muÅ¿t abound, 2 Tim. 3.2. This Å¿inne is committed five waies, or there are five kinds or degrees of unthankfull men. FirÅ¿t, when men doe not acknowledge God as the Authour and giver of their benefits and bleÅ¿Å¿ings, but finde out others, as HoÅ¿ea 2.8, 9. <hi>Shee knew not that the Lord gave her Corne.</hi> Secondly, when men doe forget him and his benefits, againÅ¿t which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> laboured.

Such were the nine Lepers. Fourthly, when not onely theÅ¿e, but recompenÅ¿e him evill for good, as that, IÅ¿aiah 1.2. <hi>I have brought up children, and they have rebelled againÅ¿t me.</hi> Deut. 32.5, 6.

But Å¿ay they be Å¿o farre inÅ¿tructed that they confeÅ¿Å¿e him the giver, yet how Å¿ome have forgotten him and his benefits. A Å¿econd brings the oblivion of the firÅ¿t, a third of that, &amp;c. As one naile drives out another, but an affliction makes all to be forgotten: as with men, one injury they doe us, makes us forget they ever did us good. But Å¿ay benefits be remembred, and oftentimes Å¿poken of, yet not Å¿o much as the afflictions and troubles: or if at one time many words to expreÅ¿Å¿e the paÅ¿Å¿ion in Å¿uffering, few in receiving; or if of them, yet as Courtiers bragge of the Kings favour, as <hi>Haman,</hi> EÅ¿ter 5.11, 12. more to magnifie himÅ¿elfe than the Kings liberality: for a long Å¿tory they will tell you of their wealth, and honour, and children, and Å¿uch like; but a few words, and that very unÅ¿avourily will they drop out of praiÅ¿e to God. They make not their Song or PÅ¿almes of thankeÅ¿giving as the faithfull have done. But if any can plead not guilty here, and be culpable in none of theÅ¿e, yet his unthankfulneÅ¿Å¿e appeares that he Å¿till remaines in his Å¿inne, and rebells againÅ¿t the Lord; not onely offending him, but by thoÅ¿e things he hath received from him: more than any married and modeÅ¿t woman will doe to her huÅ¿band, by the Rings, Chaines, Bracelets, Apparrell, and ornaments he gave her to adorne her, Å¿o Å¿he might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him; not that Å¿hee Å¿hould give to an adulterer, to entice him to folly. And yet what elÅ¿e doe many, but by their riches and honours, their health and beautie, by their Å¿trength and valour, and Å¿uch like, diÅ¿honour him? By their riches they waxe proud againÅ¿t God, by their honours and high places they oppreÅ¿Å¿e others without feare: health makes them Å¿tudy the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orning and trimming of the body, by their beautie they entice others, by their valour they contemne others, and like mighty <hi>Nimrods</hi> they tyrannize in peace and warre: Å¿o that God for all his coÅ¿t hath not Grapes, but Å¿ower Grapes, as IÅ¿aiah 5.

It is anÅ¿wered, that the magiÅ¿trate muÅ¿t be obeyed; for God hath given him a larger CommiÅ¿Å¿ion then to them, for they themÅ¿elves are Å¿ubject, as their children; who neither may doe, nor command contrary to their authority, but doing Å¿o he Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and the Å¿onne Å¿inneth in obeying. Againe Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands commonly reÅ¿pect common good, and the good that is more common, is more excellent; a common good muÅ¿t not be neglected for a private; nor this preferred before it. A mans countrey is to be preferred before his parents, and the goods of it: And to obey them, were not a good thing, for<note n="d" place="margin">Bouum non Å¿uo loco non eÅ¿t bonum.</note> a good thing out of its place, is not good; blood out of the veines in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther veÅ¿Å¿els is hurtfull, though in his place the life conÅ¿iÅ¿t in it. A good thing not done in his place, were better undone, yea it cannot be well done. Moreover, we muÅ¿t diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h betwixt the affection and action. A man may love his parents better then the magiÅ¿trate, but he muÅ¿t obey him rather; as he may love a good man, better then a great man, yet in many caÅ¿es he is not bound to doe Å¿o much for him. The firÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e God hath Å¿hewed his Å¿peciall love more to him, then them. The Å¿econd,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:151759:47"/>becauÅ¿e God hath given him a great authority of command. So 'tis in this inward affection, and outward obedience, becauÅ¿e the bond of nature is Å¿tronger in the one, and the force of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is greater in the other. Finally, if the things prejudice the State, they muÅ¿t not be obeyed; but if it doe not prejudice the publique good, and be much benefit to a private parent, Å¿o the ends of the two be regarded, &amp; no contempt of authority Å¿hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp; a man be content to abide the penalty; A man may diÅ¿obey, and prefer Parents before MagiÅ¿trates without Å¿inne to God.

For Gen. 2.24. is Å¿poken comparatively, when the one muÅ¿t be forÅ¿aken, or in caÅ¿es that Å¿o fall out that both be in queÅ¿tion.

But of this Å¿in MaÅ¿ters are often the cauÅ¿es of it, and they that bring it upon themÅ¿elves.</p>
                        <p>FirÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e they have beene Å¿uch Å¿ervants to their MaÅ¿ters, and Å¿o have lived in it ever Å¿ince without repentance; even then when God recompenceth them home, yet they will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their owne Å¿inne, but are Å¿till brawling with their Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and Å¿o it is Gods juÅ¿t retribution: whereas if they would repent of that, they Å¿hould better reforme this, EccleÅ¿. 7.21, 22. Take no heed to all words that are Å¿poken, leÅ¿t thou heare thy Å¿ervant curÅ¿e thee; for oft-times alÅ¿o thy owne heart know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that thou thy Å¿elfe haÅ¿t alÅ¿o curÅ¿ed others. It may be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this, though it carry Å¿omewhat more: That a MaÅ¿ter, when his Å¿ervant revileth him, or uÅ¿eth him irreverently, Å¿hould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member even this Å¿entence, to make him penitent and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, becauÅ¿e they have remitted of that ancient Å¿everity in their government, which we heare men, that can remember times that are paÅ¿t, Å¿peake of; not having thoÅ¿e Å¿trait eyes, nor hard hands over them as they ought, not Å¿o Å¿harply correcting them as the offence and nature of a Å¿ervant requireth; Å¿o that they little reverence them, for they feare them not, becauÅ¿e they forget that of Prov. 29.19. <hi>A Å¿ervant will not be corrected by words, for though he understand, he will not anÅ¿wer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, becauÅ¿e they bring them up too liberally for diet and apparrell, and Å¿o when the belly is full, and the back fine, the MaÅ¿ter is not Å¿o regarded. A Å¿ervant is like in this thing to a HorÅ¿e full fed and pampered, he will caÅ¿t his rider; like to <hi>Buce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:151759:54"/>Alexanders</hi> HorÅ¿e; while he was bare-backt he would carry any man; but if once he had his trappings and furniture, none, or hardly <hi>Alexander</hi> himÅ¿elfe. It is the complaint of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that Å¿ervants are thus inÅ¿olent to themÅ¿elves and others; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, though not all, are the cauÅ¿es of it themÅ¿elves; (Å¿omewhat there is in the nature of a Å¿ervant and other things) for they bring them up Å¿o delicately, as Prov. 29.21. <hi>He that delicately bringeth up his Å¿ervant from a child, Å¿hall have him become his Å¿onne at the length.</hi> WhatÅ¿oever their fare is, their apparrell is farre exceeding; a Å¿ervant going better than a man of his MaÅ¿ters place and wealth did Å¿ome few yeares agoe. And though they will not allow it themÅ¿elves, yet they can be content their friends, or themÅ¿elves, if their fortune be allotted unto them, Å¿hould provide it for themÅ¿elves: And if, when they are thus gay without, they uÅ¿e them as <hi>Hagar</hi> did her MiÅ¿tris, when Å¿he was bigge with child, is it not juÅ¿t with them? A great cauÅ¿e of this, is taking of Apprentices with great portions, and Å¿o as <hi>Mulier cum dote,</hi> is <hi>imperioÅ¿a,</hi> Å¿o they and their friends. The cauÅ¿e you muÅ¿t have Å¿uch portions with them, more than in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, is this, becauÅ¿e they muÅ¿t thus be maintained, more than in former times. But better it were that you had leÅ¿Å¿e, and kept them more meanely; better for you, you Å¿hould have more reverence and reÅ¿pect: better for them, for thus you bring Å¿in upon them for the preÅ¿ent, and in future time juÅ¿t contempt, as they have contemned you.</p>

InÅ¿tances will make the point more evident; for thee to withdraw thy Å¿elf on the Lords Sabboth, from publique exerciÅ¿es is unlawfull; But thy maÅ¿ter commands thee to Å¿tay at home, either whole or part of the day; I Å¿ee not, but thou mayÅ¿t doe it, and without Å¿inne: The maÅ¿ter may command it without Å¿inne, if he dwell farre from neighbours, as in the Country, for the preÅ¿ervation
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:151759:56"/>of the things God hath given him; and if nigh unto neighbors, yet for his children, who either muÅ¿t be troubleÅ¿ome to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, as too many are, and hinder many from hearing, or muÅ¿t be kept at home, which cannot be without danger, if Å¿ome one of diÅ¿cretion be not with them: here he may lawfully command, and thou lawfully obey, which thou couldeÅ¿t not doe without: But he may doe it unlawfully, when he hath no Å¿uch occaÅ¿ion, yet thou muÅ¿t doe it and may, Å¿o he imploy thee not about Å¿ervile workes on that day, and in that time: The reaÅ¿on is, becauÅ¿e the Lords day may beÅ¿anctified privately, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique exerciÅ¿es are not of abÅ¿olute neceÅ¿Å¿ity in the Å¿anctifying of it; for then priÅ¿oners and Å¿icke perÅ¿ons, and Å¿uch as lye lame, Å¿hould not be able to Å¿anctifie it: They onely are of neceÅ¿Å¿ity, when they can be had without apparent breach of Å¿ome other commandements; and yet maiÅ¿t thou make this unlawfull to thee; when if thou be left at home, thy MaÅ¿ter and MiÅ¿tris are gone to Church, but thou art with a child in thy armes, or without gazing at the dore, or gadding abroad, or having thy companions comming to thee, and Å¿pendeÅ¿t thy time prophanely, when thou oughteÅ¿t, Å¿o much as may be, to Å¿pend it in reading the word, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating on that thou haÅ¿t heard in the forenoon or former time, or Å¿uch like. And in this thou muÅ¿t take heed how thou Å¿etÅ¿t God, and thy maÅ¿ter, one againÅ¿t another: another inÅ¿tance, thy maÅ¿ter commands, that is unlawfull for him to bid, not for the thing, but his affection; thou muÅ¿t obey, having firÅ¿t wiÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and humbly Å¿ought to turne thy maÅ¿ter from Å¿uch a Å¿inne: As betwixt <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Joabs</hi> numbring of the people, 2 Sam. 24.2, 3. But the thing he commands is unlawfull, as well as his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I meane not Å¿imply, but by circumÅ¿tance or conÅ¿equent, yet thou mayÅ¿t obey, as being an Officers Clerke to receive more fees then is due, being extortion; or a Noble mans bailiffe his extreame racke rents; providing that in humility thou Å¿hew thy diÅ¿like of it, Å¿eeke to reforme it, or doe it with Å¿orrow and griefe while thou art bound to it, and get thy Å¿elf rid of Å¿uch a Å¿ervice Å¿o Å¿oone as thou may. But if he command thee any thing Å¿imply that is Å¿inne, as to Å¿weare for his gaine, to lye for his commodity, to deceive, to Å¿teale, or any Å¿uch things, thou mayÅ¿t not obey, and yet not rebell, but Å¿uffer.</p>

But if they have not, or thinke they have not deÅ¿erved it, how ready are their anÅ¿wers? how Å¿oone will they turne upon their MaÅ¿ters, and take the rod by the end? and if they be rebuked, they murmure; if they be corrected, they either will reÅ¿iÅ¿t, or clamorouÅ¿ly complaine, or wickedly Å¿eeke revenge. Let theÅ¿e know and Å¿ee their Å¿in, and looke for a recompence from the Lord; for, Å¿aith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> they have loÅ¿t their thankes, it is not thankes worthy, if they had Å¿uffered for evill; what when they will not? undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let them looke from God, which rewardeth every man, they Å¿hall have their recompence from him, if they repent not; it may be in this life with the like, (if not in the life to come) with wicked and lewd Å¿ervants. But of this Å¿inne, if we may enquire the cauÅ¿es of it, we Å¿hall find in many, to come from the Parents and friends, either in their education, bringing them up cockeringly, never uÅ¿ing them to reproofes, to the rod, and to the yoke; but as my young MaÅ¿ters, and Å¿uch as never Å¿hould come to Å¿erve; Å¿o that when they muÅ¿t to it, by no meanes they can apply themÅ¿elves unto it, but in it endure and Å¿uffer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, not Å¿o much as Å¿harpe words, but no blowes, deÅ¿erved, or not. But this is not all their fault, for it is Å¿econded with as bad when they are in Å¿ervice, and find Å¿ome hardneÅ¿Å¿e, and as they onely thinke, Å¿harpneÅ¿Å¿e; they remembring the fondneÅ¿Å¿e of their affection, complaine to them, who doe not as they Å¿hould, correct them Å¿oundly, and Å¿end them home againe; but
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:151759:57"/>goe to their MaÅ¿ters, and expoÅ¿tulate the matter for them; exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate the fact, aggravate the MaÅ¿ters hard dealing, upbraid him with what he gave him with his friend or child, and Å¿o ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate them, that they will be in nothing Å¿ufferers after, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without grudging and repining. Another cauÅ¿e is in the maÅ¿ter, either becauÅ¿e he was Å¿uch, and is Å¿uch becauÅ¿e he hath not repented; and Å¿o it is Gods retribution, <hi>ut ante;</hi> or becauÅ¿e he hath beene too remiÅ¿Å¿e to let faults, many and little, eÅ¿cape without reproofe and correction, that when he would for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he cannot Å¿ubdue them; or paÅ¿Å¿ed by Å¿ome greater faults in Å¿ome other of his Å¿ervants for Å¿ome Å¿iniÅ¿ter reÅ¿pect, as becauÅ¿e he would not be accounted cruell and Å¿evere, which in the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tice of God, and the cankred nature of another Å¿ervant is payed him home, becauÅ¿e he never feared to be accounted cruell of God, and Å¿uch an one as hates his Å¿ervant; for that will hold in Å¿ervants, Prov. 13.24. <hi>He that Å¿pareth his rod, hateth his Å¿onne; but he that loveth him, chaÅ¿teneth him betimes;</hi> and Å¿o being aÅ¿ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in a licentious and corrupt age to be accounted hard and Å¿trait, he hath Å¿hame laid upon him by a rebellious Å¿ervant, as we may apply, Prov. 29.15. <hi>The rod and reproofe giveth wiÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but a Child left to himÅ¿elfe, bringeth his mother to Å¿hame.</hi> A third cauÅ¿e is in the MagiÅ¿trate, to whom the maÅ¿ter complains, as he may and muÅ¿t in a deÅ¿perate cauÅ¿e, who by the Å¿ervants friends or meanes he makes to him, will either reprove and checke the maÅ¿ter, which he ought not to doe, though there be Å¿ome Å¿mall cauÅ¿e; nor, if great cauÅ¿e, yet not before the friends or face of the Å¿ervant, and little or not at all reprove, or not Å¿everely correct that Å¿ervant, by which not onely he is made more bold againÅ¿t his maÅ¿ter, but even other Å¿ervants are ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated againÅ¿t theirs, and the maÅ¿ters utterly diÅ¿couraged to Å¿eeke any helpe from them.</p>

If a father beget a Å¿onne, whom Å¿hall he rather Å¿erve and honour than his father, which begat him? And if this, then how much more to him that is the Father of Fathers, and of all things in earth and Heaven? It is heard from many men, when they reprove others for Å¿ome diÅ¿honouring of God, and often, but as they thinke; It is not for your profeÅ¿Å¿ion; doth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a man of that zeale you make Å¿hew of, profeÅ¿Å¿ing Å¿o great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as you doe.

Set faith and repentance aÅ¿ide, things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿ible not commanded in the Law, what is it thou art not bound to, either for piety or honeÅ¿ty, and that by the Creation? for the Law holds faÅ¿t there, and Creation onely binds to all Å¿uch duties.

And if to diÅ¿honour a father, be a vile crime in a Å¿onne, what is it to Å¿inne and rebell againÅ¿t God, who is father Å¿o many wayes? Let every man then bethink himÅ¿elfe of this, and Å¿ee in himÅ¿elfe how many things he hath to move him to honour God, though he never looke without himÅ¿elfe; body, Å¿oule, all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and powers and parts of both, becauÅ¿e his hands made them: And if the Axe may not boaÅ¿t it Å¿elfe againÅ¿t him that heweth with it, IÅ¿a. 10.15. how may it againÅ¿t him that made it?

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:151759:62"/>and that we have received, one will give him his heart, another his body, not his heart; another will part both with him, as if he created not both as one, as if his title be not as great to one as to another, or to the whole, as to part: He is the Father of our Å¿pirits, and the Father of our bodies; or if thou wilt give one, and not the other, thou condemneÅ¿t thy Å¿elfe by the one, for with-holding the other; for his right is in this reÅ¿pect to both, and muÅ¿t have both, and be honoured in the whole. But why pay they as much, becauÅ¿e they would receive more, and have not yet enough? So in this no man is perfect, though he have received much.

But if but the Å¿ervile feare, then onely when thou feeleÅ¿t his hand, or feareÅ¿t an imminent danger, or haÅ¿t the freÅ¿h remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of a judgment which is but new taken from him, for which a Child of God muÅ¿t and ought to feare: but then are not theÅ¿e the principall cauÅ¿es of feare in him, for theÅ¿e he feares, and flies Å¿in, but principally for the other. If a filiall feare, thou art afraid to offend in lieu of thankfulneÅ¿Å¿e, for thy being and preÅ¿ervation, and all thy manifold bleÅ¿Å¿ings received already: If a Å¿ervile, onely for feare of evills, or hope of that which is to come. It is the whip, the Å¿courge, and the rod that cauÅ¿eth the hypocrite as an AÅ¿Å¿e, a foole, and a Å¿tave to forbeare and leave Å¿inne; but it is love, conÅ¿cience, and obedience that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Gods Children willingly to abhorre it. <hi>Nazianz.</hi> if thou bee'Å¿t a Å¿lave and a Å¿ervant, Å¿tand in feare of the whip or the Å¿courge; if an hireling, worke for thy wages, expect thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: but if over and above all theÅ¿e, thou beeÅ¿t a Å¿onne, doe good, becauÅ¿e it is thy duty to pleaÅ¿e and obÅ¿erve thy father, from whom thou haÅ¿t received Å¿o much good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                        <p>The third difference of theÅ¿e two feares is this; the one is a loving feare, and the other is a hatefull feare; the firÅ¿t is joyned with love, Å¿uch as good Å¿ubjects beare to good Princes, and ordinarily children beare to their fathers. The Å¿econd is joyned with hatred, Å¿uch as Å¿ervants beare to their hard and cruell Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters; the one would, if they could, withdraw themÅ¿elves out of Gods government, and get out of his Å¿ight, as <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 3. as a fugitive Å¿ervant, as <hi>Hagar,</hi> Gen. 16. the other would not willingly away from God, but Å¿ubmitteth himÅ¿elfe unto him, and Å¿eeketh as he can, to preÅ¿Å¿e neerer and neerer, as farre as he dare with due reverence of his MajeÅ¿ty, like the Prodigall Å¿onne, who came home to his father, and yeelded himÅ¿elfe willingly into his hands. And therefore it is a true Å¿aying, that after Å¿inne the wicked are troubled, they cannot get themÅ¿elves farre enough from God; and the godly are troubled, they can not come neere enough home to him: the one is afraid of the loÅ¿ing of God, the other is afraid of Gods finding of him: of that, Å¿aith <hi>AuguÅ¿tine,</hi> in 1 John 4. it is called <hi>caÅ¿tus timer,</hi> a chaÅ¿te feare.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:151759:65"/>Tis one thing to feare God, leÅ¿t he Å¿end thee to Hell,<note place="margin">Aliud eÅ¿t timere Deum ne te mittat in Gehennam, aliud ne ipÅ¿e Ã  te recedat ille non eÅ¿t caÅ¿tus qui non venit ab amore Dei, Å¿edex timore poenae, iÅ¿te caÅ¿tus eÅ¿t quia venit ex amore Dei quem amlecteris. <hi>AuguÅ¿t.</hi> in <hi>1</hi> Joh. <hi>4</hi>
                           </note> another leÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe depart from thee: that feare is not chaÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e it comes not from the love of God, but from the feare of puniÅ¿hment; but this is chaÅ¿t, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e it comes from the love of God, whom thou delighteÅ¿t in. So that this filiall feare agreeth with the love of Gods MajeÅ¿ty, yea it riÅ¿eth out of love, a man is afrayd to offend one that he loveth, but the Å¿ervile fear is joyned with the deadly hatred of God. And Å¿o as it is Å¿aid, whom they feare they hate,<note place="margin">Quem metu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt oderunt, &amp; quem ode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt periiÅ¿Å¿e cupiunt.</note> and they deÅ¿ire he may periÅ¿h whom they hate. So it may be Å¿aid of this, that by it he is not <hi>homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cida,</hi> a manÅ¿layer, but <hi>Deicida,</hi> a GodÅ¿layer, wiÅ¿hing there were never a God to puniÅ¿h him.</p>
                        <p>The fourth difference of theÅ¿e two feares, is in their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which is manifeÅ¿t.</p>
                        <p>FirÅ¿t, If we conÅ¿ider them in divers Å¿ubjects, for the one is but for a bront, like lightning that giveth a flaÅ¿h and is gone, and comes in an inÅ¿tant; never ceizeth upon the Å¿oule, nor dwelleth in the heart. For inÅ¿tance we may take <hi>Pharoah,</hi> Exod. Chap. 27, 28, 29, 30. Å¿o <hi>Ahab,</hi> when <hi>Eliah</hi> had Å¿ummoned him, hee feares, 1 King. 21.27. but Å¿oone after he goes feareleÅ¿Å¿e to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth Gilead,</hi> 1 King. 22.26, 27. The filiall feare is permanent, and conÅ¿tant, as the cauÅ¿es of it are, IÅ¿a. 11.2. Prov. 28.14. For it is no naturall worke, but a Å¿upernaturall habit.</p>
                        <p>Secndly if we conÅ¿ider them in one Å¿ubject, the one outla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿teth and overlives the other. 1 Joh. 4.18. <hi>perfect love caÅ¿teth out feare;</hi> that is, Å¿ervile feare, but PÅ¿al. 19.9. <hi>The feare of the Lord is cleane, enduring for ever,</hi> that is, filiall feare, when it comes, it caÅ¿ts out that, becauÅ¿e it brings with it aÅ¿Å¿urance of God favour. It remaines Å¿till, having the leÅ¿Å¿e paine and trouble with it the longer it laÅ¿teth, and the more forward it commeth to perfection: And this feare is Å¿o laÅ¿ting that it remaines after this life; not that the bleÅ¿Å¿ed Å¿hall fear either leÅ¿t they Å¿hould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, for they are then without danger of falling; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Gods power, and his incomparable, and his incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henÅ¿ible graces, there Å¿hall be a reverent dread, and yet delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, Å¿uch as the Angels have now in Heaven: As Angels feare, IÅ¿aiah 6.2, 3, 4. when they are in the preÅ¿ence of God; for as we reverence a great man in regard of his place, though he beare us no evill will, nor we expect any evill from him; So no doubt, the holy Saints and Angels in Heaven in regard of God, though they neither feare to loÅ¿e him, becauÅ¿e they can not fall from him, nor to offend him, becauÅ¿e there is no danger to diÅ¿pleaÅ¿e him, yet they reverence him Å¿till in regard of his MajeÅ¿ty, which they can neither Å¿ufficiently admire nor adore.</p>
                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:151759:65"/>
                        <p>Now further by theÅ¿e two differences, as by the former, may every man examine himÅ¿elfe, whether he hath a childelike or Å¿ervile feare.</p>
                        <p>As by the firÅ¿t, whether thou loveÅ¿t or hateÅ¿t God for feare:<note place="margin">Deum tua peccata vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care aut non poÅ¿Å¿e, aut nol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, aut ea ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cire, vis ergÃ² Deum non eÅ¿Å¿e Deum, qui vis eum aut injuÅ¿tum eÅ¿Å¿e, aut impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem aut in Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientem. Bern. de Temp. <hi>58.</hi>
                           </note> wouldeÅ¿t thou flee from God, when thou haÅ¿t offended, couldÅ¿t thou wiÅ¿h he were not? If thou deÅ¿ireÅ¿t that either he knew not thy Å¿innes, or could not or would not puniÅ¿h them; then thou wouldÅ¿t that God were not, when thou deÅ¿ireÅ¿t hee were ignorant, or impotent, or unjuÅ¿t: And hence thy wretched heart under this feare even hates God, thou haÅ¿t but a Å¿ervile feare; but canÅ¿t thou yeeld thy Å¿elfe to God, and draw neere to him, fearing to be forÅ¿aken of God, being willing to yeeld thy Å¿elf into his hands? this is filiall feare. There is Å¿ayth <hi>AuguÅ¿tine</hi> an unchaÅ¿te adulterous woman, who feareth her huÅ¿band, but Å¿he feareth him, becauÅ¿e Å¿he loveth her naughtineÅ¿Å¿e, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his company is not delighfull, but burthen Å¿ome unto her, and loving evill Å¿he is afrayd of his comming, leÅ¿t he finde her Å¿o. There is a chaÅ¿te woman, Å¿he loveth and affecteth her huÅ¿band, and liveth with him in good Å¿ort, and would never have him out of Å¿ight; now aÅ¿k them both whether they fear their huÅ¿bands? they will Å¿ay they doe; there is the Å¿ame anÅ¿wer, but not the Å¿ame minde. AÅ¿ke them why? and that will put the difference,<note place="margin">
                              <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>na vox, non eadem mens.</note> the one anÅ¿wereth leÅ¿t he Å¿hould come home and finde her, and finde out her lewdneÅ¿Å¿e and lightneÅ¿Å¿e; the other, leÅ¿t being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent he Å¿hould depart, and leÅ¿t he Å¿hould love her leÅ¿Å¿e, and by any offence of hers be eÅ¿tranged. As he much miÅ¿liketh the former woman, Å¿o miÅ¿like thy Å¿elf if thou fear God in that Å¿ort, and carry thy Å¿elf Å¿o to God in this Å¿ort, as thou wouldÅ¿t thy wife Å¿hould be affected unto thee.</p>
                        <p>By the Å¿econd, is thy feare momentany, Å¿oone come, Å¿oone gone, doeÅ¿t thou not feare awayes? then feare thy feare it is not true. If thou haÅ¿t overcome thy Å¿ervile feare, and doÅ¿t not feare Å¿till, thou canÅ¿t not have true feare; for as love expels one feare and caÅ¿ts it out, Å¿o it cauÅ¿eth another, and that Å¿uch a feare as is never afterwards extinguiÅ¿hed, though the act &amp; working of it be Å¿omtime more freÅ¿h then others, yet the habit is never loÅ¿t.</p>
                        <p>The third thing touching this filiall feare is the effects of it. And theÅ¿e I reduce to theÅ¿e heads, Å¿uch as awfull and dutifull children have, and Å¿o may well be Å¿o reÅ¿embled.</p>
                        <p>The firÅ¿t is a deÅ¿ire to know his will and pleaÅ¿ure, to finde it out, and a delight in doing of it: As a child will be deÅ¿irous to know his fathers minde, that he may not offend him, and be ready to doe it of himÅ¿elfe when he hath found it; hence that PÅ¿al. 112.1. <hi>BleÅ¿Å¿ed is the man that feareth the Lord, that deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth greatly in his commandements.</hi> See it by the contrary, Job. 21.9, 14 <hi>Their houÅ¿es are Å¿afe from feare, neyther is the rod of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:151759:66"/>them; Therefore they Å¿ay unto God, depart from us: for we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ire not the knowledge of thy wayes.</hi> PÅ¿al. 25.12, 13. <hi>What man is he that feareth the Lord? him Å¿hall he teach in the way that he Å¿hall chuÅ¿e; his Å¿oule Å¿hall dwell at eaÅ¿e, and his Å¿eed Å¿hall inherit the Earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Å¿econd is, a Å¿uÅ¿pition and jelouÅ¿y of particular actions, leÅ¿t they Å¿hould doe that unawares, which might be offenÅ¿ive to God. A good childe, if he doubt to doe ought that he thinketh his father will not like of, he will firÅ¿t aÅ¿ke the queÅ¿tion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will have him doe it or no, and let it alone till he know his minde in the matter: Å¿o a childe of God, he will be carefull to try all his workes by his will and his word, and to abÅ¿taine till he know what his good will, and his pleaÅ¿ure is. Thus was <hi>Job</hi> zealous of his children, Job. 1.5. Å¿o of his owne wife, Job. 9.28. Therefore the Å¿pirit commends him for a man fearing God, and Å¿uch as none was like, yea as the devill could finde no fault with him, Rom. 14.5. he will be fully perÅ¿waded it is Gods will, before he doe it. 1 TheÅ¿Å¿al. 5.21. not enough to Å¿ay, I doe not know it unlawfull; better debarrre our Å¿elves of Å¿ome lawfull things, then doe one unlawfull. EccleÅ¿. 5.5, 6.</p>
                        <p>The third is, a wary Å¿hunning and avoyding of things he knows will offend, as an awfull child will hardly be drawn, or woed to do ought that his father hath expreÅ¿Å¿ely forbidden him, or that will diÅ¿pleaÅ¿e him; as <hi>Jacob</hi> to lye and deceive his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Gen. 27. or if he be drawn, yet if his father come Å¿udden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon him, and finde him about it or beginning it, he will Å¿tay his hand Å¿oone and bee aÅ¿hamed of himÅ¿elfe: Å¿o the man that feares God, will not be woed and urged to thoÅ¿e things that he knoweth cannot but offend God. So <hi>JoÅ¿eph,</hi> Gen. 39.9. <hi>There is none greater in his houÅ¿e then I: neither hath he kept back any thing from mee but thee, becauÅ¿e thou art his wife; how then can I doe this great wickedneÅ¿Å¿e and Å¿inne againÅ¿t God?</hi> Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah 5.15. <hi>The former governours that had been before mee, were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides forty Å¿hekels of Å¿ilver, yea even their Å¿ervants bare rule over the people, but Å¿o did not I, becauÅ¿e of the feare of God.</hi> Or if by caÅ¿e of infirmity or Å¿trength of temptation he be violently car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away, yet if he Å¿hall but once Å¿eriouÅ¿ly thinke of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ence of God about him, it will make him for Å¿hame to Å¿tay, or breake off the practice of Å¿inne, as in <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 24.10. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids <hi>heart Å¿mote him, and he Å¿aid, I have done very fooliÅ¿hly.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The fourth is, a griefe and a feare to Å¿ee ought done by others that may provoke God to wrath, as a good childe will be loath any of his brethren or any of the Å¿ervants Å¿hould doe ought that may anger his father, if it be but the diÅ¿quieting of him: Å¿o a true child of God will be vexed to Å¿ee others take Å¿uch courÅ¿es as
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:151759:66"/>may be offenÅ¿ive to his heavenly father. So that 2 Pet. 2.7. and <hi>David,</hi> PÅ¿al. 119.53.136.139.158. Å¿uch are commended and marked, Ezechiel 9. as they are condemned, 1 Cor. 5.1. who doe contrary.</p>
                        <p>The fifth, a trembling at the wrath and anger of God decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for Å¿inne either in word or deed.</p>
                        <p>FirÅ¿t, in word at Gods threatnings either againÅ¿t him Å¿elfe or others, as a child quaketh and trembleth at his fathers chyding, though it be with Å¿ome others; Å¿o doe the children of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly when they heare the wrath of God, denounced againÅ¿t others, Å¿o is it, IÅ¿a. 66.2. PÅ¿al. 119.161. 2 Chro. 34.27. Jer. 26 18. Habacuk. 3.16.</p>
                        <p>Now Å¿econdly, if at his word, how much more at his rod; if when he Å¿peaks, more when he beats themÅ¿elves, or others: as a child if he Å¿ee his father to take the rod in hand to correct any of the family, he Å¿tandeth trembling, and quaking, he feareth leÅ¿t he Å¿hould have a wipe by the way; Å¿o the child of God feareth as before Gods face, when he Å¿eeth the hand of God upon others, as when he feeleth it upon himÅ¿elfe, <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 6.7.9. the Church, Acts. 5.11. PÅ¿al. 119.119, 120. Habacuk. 3.16.</p>
                        <p>Now theÅ¿e being the effects, and as it were the fruits of this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liall feare, it Å¿hall be good for a man to examine himÅ¿elf by them, whether he have it, or no; for by the fruits you Å¿hall know it: It is to be feared that if men will doe this Å¿eriouÅ¿ly, but a few of thoÅ¿e who call God father every day, wilbe found to have this filiall feare, and Å¿o his Å¿onnes indeed. The firÅ¿t fruit, is a deÅ¿ire to know, and finde out Gods will, and then to doe it; but alas how many have wee that refuÅ¿e to Å¿eek after the knowledge of his wayes; like thoÅ¿e, Job. 21.14. but Å¿ay Å¿ome will Å¿earch the word, yet it is onely to furniÅ¿h themÅ¿elves with matter of diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courÅ¿e; and not to finde out that which may Å¿erve, to order and direct their lives; they are a curious kinde of Men, and as <hi>Seneca</hi> Å¿aith, <hi>scholae non vitae diÅ¿citur;</hi> they Å¿tudy Å¿choole quirks, and not points of practice, others are Å¿orry many times, that they lighted on more then they looked after: As the yong man not anÅ¿wered to his mind, was Å¿orry he had aÅ¿ked; Luke 15.25. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath obÅ¿erved of his expereince, <hi>Cant. Å¿er.</hi> 74. many (Å¿aith he) have I known, made Å¿ad upon the knowledge of the truth, becauÅ¿e they could not Å¿o pretend ignorance as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ber.</hi> in Cant. Å¿erm. <hi>74.</hi>
                           </note> Or if not this, but with the Å¿onne in the GoÅ¿pell Å¿tay, and doe not, or deferre as <hi>Jonah,</hi> or doe as <hi>Balaam,</hi> bleÅ¿Å¿e, when he would have curÅ¿ed; Å¿o they, their hands go againÅ¿t their hearts; theÅ¿e, and Å¿uch like, muÅ¿t needs be voyd of this feare.</p>
                        <p>The Å¿econd is a jealouÅ¿ie over his particular actions; but how many runne headlong into all actions, never regarding what
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:151759:67"/>warrant they have for them; that though never Å¿o many make doubt of them, and the lawfulneÅ¿Å¿e of them, yet all is one to them, as they know nothing for them, Å¿o they know nothing againÅ¿t them: and they eyther doe as <hi>Peter,</hi> Luke 22.49.50. who cut off <hi>Malchus</hi> eare before he could heare his anÅ¿wer; or as Prov. 20.25. <hi>doe things firÅ¿t, and examine them after.</hi> TheÅ¿e are farre from this feare; for where it is, there if any doubt ariÅ¿e about an action that Å¿eemed indifferent before, he will be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of himÅ¿elfe, and walke the Å¿ureÅ¿t way, when he knoweth he may doe or abÅ¿taine without offence, but he is in Å¿ome Å¿uÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of the other, he will rather be Å¿ure to goe on a good ground, than hazard the incurring of Gods diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure, though he loÅ¿e Å¿omewhat, yea much, both of his profit and pleaÅ¿ure, knowing the feare of God is oppoÅ¿ite to this manner of wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and Å¿o 'tis made. EccleÅ¿. 5.1, 5, 6.</p>
                        <p>The third is a carefull avoiding of knowne Å¿innes, and things that will offend; but how many give liberty to their fleÅ¿h, runne with a full Å¿winge into the practice of Å¿inne, and never care to returne out of it againe; who vaunt of this feare, and yet often vaunt of their Å¿innes, and never Å¿hame at them. Nay, Å¿ooner Å¿hame and bluÅ¿h to be a man noted, to have a care to avoid the common Å¿innes of the age; how have theÅ¿e men any child-like feare? will they account that their children doe lovingly feare them, when they runne into all or many things they know will diÅ¿pleaÅ¿e them, and are aÅ¿hamed to be accounted more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily dutifull? QueÅ¿tionleÅ¿Å¿e no; then let them be their own Judges, and Å¿hall; for they tell us, they have no feare, if that be their feare. Prov. 8.13.</p>
                        <p>The fourth is a griefe to Å¿ee others offend, but many boaÅ¿t of the feare of God, and yet they delight and take pleaÅ¿ure in the Å¿ight and hearing of other mens Å¿innes, never caring nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding what others doe, Å¿o they be not like them. They can dayly Å¿ee many <hi>Laodiceans</hi> neither hot, nor cold, amongÅ¿t us; many <hi>EpheÅ¿ians,</hi> that have loÅ¿t their firÅ¿t love; many JebuÅ¿ites, Idolaters amongÅ¿t us, and Å¿warming amongÅ¿t us; theÅ¿e they Å¿ee, and yet they Å¿igh not at it; nay, either take pleaÅ¿ure or make profit by it: it is but a boaÅ¿t, they are void of the filiall feare of God, becauÅ¿e they have no care whether he be honoured or diÅ¿honoured; pleaÅ¿ed, or diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed; as if a Child could endure his fathers diÅ¿honour, if not be revenged of them, for want of power and Å¿uch like, yet will he mourne and Å¿orrow. How Å¿hould I beare my fathers diÅ¿honour? and if theÅ¿e, much more thoÅ¿e who Å¿eeke to draw others to Å¿inne, Å¿wearing, whoring, drunkenneÅ¿Å¿e, and Å¿uch like; they can have no true feare of God as Children.</p>
                        <p>The fifth, trembling at his judgments threatened or executed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:151759:67"/>upon others. Many Å¿ay they feare God, and yet they can heare the wrath and judgments of God denounced againÅ¿t Å¿inne, and it may be the Å¿innes they practiÅ¿e, yet are never a whit moved at all, but goe as they came, as if the Word were but wind: As jer. 5.13. Their hearts melt not, nor they mourne not; nay, when they Å¿ee Gods judgments upon others, they cenÅ¿ure and condemne them, but feare nothing themÅ¿elves; nay, often when they are in the Å¿ame condemnation, if they be not in the Å¿ame puniÅ¿hment. Sure it is, they have no child-like feare at all, they are worÅ¿e than the beaÅ¿ts, yea, Å¿enÅ¿eleÅ¿Å¿e things, who tremble at his voice; and they Å¿hew themÅ¿elves Children of wrath: <hi>Onely the children of wrath are feareleÅ¿Å¿e of wrath,</hi>

All Soveraignes and Lords looke for all feare and obedience from Å¿uch as they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne, protect, and whoÅ¿e good and peace they procure: All MaÅ¿ters from Å¿ervants they feed, and cloath, and governe; and this they yeeld unto them, how much more all men to God, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, their Soveraigne, and Lord of all, and over all? Therefore all, high and low, Kings and Subjects, Male and Female, bond and free, rich and poore, owe this to him, and are bound unto him for it. For Kings rule, the great ones governe, the rich proÅ¿per, the poore live by him, yea, all are under him; he preÅ¿erveth and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth all. WhatÅ¿oever priviledge one man hath above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet there is no priviledge in reÅ¿pect of God. If the King reigned without him, if the Noble ruled without him, if the rich increaÅ¿ed without him, it were Å¿omewhat; but when none of theÅ¿e, all is by his providence, and from his power, which makes him Å¿ay to all, If I be a MaÅ¿ter or Lord, where is my feare? The King is great but in reÅ¿pect of his Å¿ubjects, nothing greater in reÅ¿pect of God than another; as the earth is but a Å¿mall mote or point in reÅ¿pect of the Heavens: the rich are weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy in reÅ¿pect of the poore, but, but poore compared with the Kings treaÅ¿ure, more poore compared with God: Å¿o that be they all great, and as high and as rich as may be, yet their Crownes and Crownets, their honours and riches, their Å¿tates and lives are in his hands. And as a Ship in one day upon the Sea would periÅ¿h without a governour, Å¿o would all theÅ¿e in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment come to nought without him, his government, protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and providence. See then how every one that acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God his Lord and MaÅ¿ter, and feeleth indeed his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and providence for good, ought to Å¿erve and feare him. If thou doeÅ¿t not beleeve that God moves all thy members when thou doeÅ¿t move, thou art not worthy the name of a ChriÅ¿tian, Å¿aith one; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught it, Acts 17.28. But if thou doeÅ¿t beleeve it, that thou receiveÅ¿t Å¿uch from him, and yet dareÅ¿t provoke and offend him, I know not what name is evill enough for thee: Å¿o for this, if thou acknowledge not all is from God, through his providence, and from his care, that thou art as thou art, thou art not worthy the name of a Å¿onne or Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: but if thou acknowledge it, and yet Å¿hakeÅ¿t off his feare,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:151759:68"/>and performeÅ¿t not obedience to him, what name is bad enough for thee? nay, what puniÅ¿hment is Å¿ufficient for Å¿uch an offence? what then, if for life and continuance, how much more for a well and wealthy being? when mens portions are made fatter, and their Å¿tate better, both than in former times, and alÅ¿o than thouÅ¿and others; Gods providence and care more to them, their obedience and Å¿ervice Å¿hould be more to him. And yet it is a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable thing, my eyes could caÅ¿t out teares for it in Å¿ecret, (as the Prophet) to Å¿ee many men riÅ¿en of nothing, when they had little, were diligent and carefull to Å¿erve and obey God in themÅ¿elves, and in their families, and thoÅ¿e who belong to them; but after that Gods government was more good to them, and they proÅ¿pering better by it, I know not how, Å¿uch is the corruption of our nature, they Å¿erve him now farre leÅ¿Å¿e in them and theirs; and yet it is thought excuÅ¿able, as if a Subject, who lived under his King, and that onely lived without wealth, or honour, or advancement, or but with a Å¿mall pittance of theÅ¿e, and then gave him Å¿ervice and all loyall duty, Å¿hould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when he had received theÅ¿e in bountifull meaÅ¿ure, by his gracious bounty and government, either leÅ¿Å¿e reÅ¿pect him, or be leÅ¿Å¿e loyall, or more rebellious, and thinke it were tolerable enough, becauÅ¿e he is now more wealthy, worÅ¿hipfull, and honourable. But whatÅ¿oever he thinks, others would condemne him, and every of theÅ¿e who deale thus with God; then Å¿hall they be judged by their owne mouth. Oh that they wuld in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed judge themÅ¿elves, that they be not judged of the Lord, 1 Cor. 11.31. elÅ¿e undoubtedly he will judge them, if his; in this life puniÅ¿hing them in thoÅ¿e things which have made them by their corruption leÅ¿Å¿e loyall unto him, as wealth, riches, honour, friends, and Å¿uch like; that he may Å¿o bring them home againe, and let them Å¿ee how they have wronged him, for great things giving him leÅ¿Å¿e. If he done not, the caÅ¿e is more fearefull, he meanes to condemne them with the world. And though they will not now acknowledge they injure God any wiÅ¿e in thus dealing outwardly with him, yet the day Å¿hall come, and it is now at hand, when this injury Å¿hall be made manifeÅ¿t, and when as theÅ¿e complaints, which are now made by us, Å¿hall be heard, though men have now their eares Å¿o heavy, and their eyes Å¿o Å¿hut up, and their hearts Å¿o fat, that they cannot Å¿ee, or heare, or underÅ¿tand to be converted and healed: It Å¿hall (Å¿aith one) be equall and right with God, that thoÅ¿e who will not now open their eyes when there is time, and while the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of bleÅ¿Å¿ings they enjoy by Gods gracious government, doth invite them to Å¿erve and feare him; yea, I Å¿ay it Å¿hall be juÅ¿t and right that their eyes Å¿hall be opened by the multitude of torments, which muÅ¿t continue for ever.

Å¿o that whatÅ¿oever they Å¿ay, we may Å¿ay, PÅ¿al. 36.1. <hi>The tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion of the wicked Å¿aith within my heart, that there is no feare of God before his eyes:</hi> when as then men goe on in their wicked courÅ¿es, and a Å¿mall pleaÅ¿ure or deÅ¿ire of it will carry them to the fulfilling of the luÅ¿ts of the fleÅ¿h, and to all voluptuouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, and practice of all pleaÅ¿ure, a Å¿mall feare make them commit any Å¿inne, and either coveting Å¿ome pleaÅ¿ure, or thinking to avoid Å¿ome diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure of the world, they onely neglect not the good, but make no bones to commit Å¿in, and to lye in it; they have not certainly come Å¿o farre as to have this Å¿ervile feare, and Å¿o they are not Å¿onnes, no not Å¿ervants of God: nay, though they have the Å¿hape of men, as <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> had, yet they have not Å¿o much underÅ¿tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a beaÅ¿t, leÅ¿Å¿e than he had. For as <hi>Bernard</hi> Å¿aith, <hi>DiverÅ¿.</hi> 12. Let us lade and over-burthen an AÅ¿Å¿e, and toyle him with labour, he cares not, becauÅ¿e he is an AÅ¿Å¿e: but if we aÅ¿Å¿ay to put him into the fire, or thruÅ¿t him into a Ditch or Quarry, he Å¿hunneth all he can, becauÅ¿e he loves life, and feareth death. And yet theÅ¿e run headlong to Hell, and breake forth into all kind of impiety, as the HorÅ¿e into the battaile, when they know theÅ¿e will worke their everlaÅ¿ting confuÅ¿ion.</p>

For if he have this feare, a man would never Å¿ell himÅ¿elfe to eternall torments for a draught of pleaÅ¿ure, or for a Million of Gold, when it might be Å¿aid to him, as JoÅ¿hua 22.18. <hi>Ye alÅ¿o are turned away this day from the Lord: and Å¿eeing yee rebell to day againÅ¿t the Lord, even to morrow he will be wroth with all the congregation of IÅ¿rael.</hi> Loe, to day he offendeth, and to morrow God will be wroth, and he Å¿hall periÅ¿h in his wrath,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:151759:71"/>Å¿urely no profit or pleaÅ¿ure tendered unto him, would make him incurre this danger. And for the other temptation, hee would eaÅ¿ily overcome it by this, even the feare of mens feare, with the feare of Gods puniÅ¿hments, and Å¿ay happily as <hi>David,</hi> though he Å¿poke it more Å¿anctifiedly, PÅ¿al. 119.161. <hi>Princes have perÅ¿ecuted me without cauÅ¿e, but mine heart Å¿tood in awe of thy words.</hi> If he have this feare, hardly Å¿uch temptations will aÅ¿Å¿ault him. For as <hi>ChryÅ¿oÅ¿t. Hom.</hi> 15. <hi>ad pop. Ant.</hi> If it be once knowne and heard that an armed Souldier Å¿tands watching in a houÅ¿e for the defence of it, there is neither thiefe nor robber, nor any that practiÅ¿eth Å¿uch evill, will come neere it. So, when feare is the keeper of mans heart, there is neither the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of pleaÅ¿ure, or profit, or worldly feare will Å¿et upon a man, but will fly away, or be eaÅ¿ily expelled, Å¿ubdued as it were by the command of feare. God hath Å¿et two Schoole-maÅ¿ters o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, <hi>Pudor &amp; Timor;</hi> Å¿hame and feare; that Å¿hould lead an ingenuous nature; but if not that, yet this Å¿hould, unleÅ¿Å¿e we will be worÅ¿e than beaÅ¿ts.</p>
                        <p>The Å¿econd effect of this feare is, that it is <hi>tanquam acus ad filum,</hi> the needle or the briÅ¿tle to the threed: that is, that as they goe before, and make way for the threed, but abide not there when it is once come, but goes out againe: So this feare firÅ¿t entereth the heart of man, and makes way for love or the Child-like feare, that loving feare, firÅ¿t when he is converted; and it entereth in for this end, to bring or draw in love after it, and love when it is once entered, caÅ¿teth feare out of doores, that made entrance before. 1 John 4.18. This is further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeÅ¿t by the example of <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 9.3, 6. and <hi>JoÅ¿iah,</hi> 2 Chron. 34.19, 27. Å¿o Act. 2.37, 38. and 16.30. Rom. 7.10.</p>
                        <p>BecauÅ¿e God reÅ¿pects and accepts men to give them grace when they are troubled, <label type="milestone">

                        <p>BecauÅ¿e mans heart is not capable of grace without this; firÅ¿t, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">ReaÅ¿. </seg>2</label> without this it is not fit to receive the impreÅ¿Å¿ion of Gods Spirit. It gives no grace, but it makes capable of grace; as we Å¿ee fire, though it give the metall no faÅ¿hion, yet it maketh it liquid, and fit to be caÅ¿t in any mould; it maketh the waxe fit to receive any impreÅ¿Å¿ion of the Seale. So this feare, though it worke no grace in the heart, but leaveth it as corrupt as it findeth it, yet it mollifieth it, and maketh it plyable for Gods Spirit to worke upon, which before could not take the Å¿tamp of Gods grace.</p>
                        <p>This manifeÅ¿teth that many men muÅ¿t needs be without grace, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Æ²Å¿e </seg>1</label> becauÅ¿e many have not had this feare, which is ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore grace, whereÅ¿oever it comes; and grace never comes any where, where this UÅ¿her hath not beene before; it is the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:151759:72"/>of grace, as <hi>John BaptiÅ¿t</hi> was of ChriÅ¿t: As God appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Elias,</hi> Å¿o he approacheth to the Å¿oule, 2 Kings 19, 12, 13, 14. he was neither in the winde, nor earthquake, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the earth, and clave the rockes, nor in the fire that devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all before it, nor he went not before them; but he was in a Å¿oft voyce which came afterwards: So is the Å¿pirit and grace of God, it goes not before the Å¿ervile feare, it is not with it, when it rends the hard hearts of men, and when it melts and mollifies them with the fire of Gods wrath; but it cometh after, and Å¿pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth peace and reÅ¿t to the Å¿oule, whereas many never taÅ¿ted of this feare, and Å¿hew it by their lives they have no feare of God, nay in words brag, they had never no Å¿uch rentings, and mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of heart, nay jeÅ¿t at thoÅ¿e which have, they Å¿hew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, voyd of grace, of true grace; yea, many who are not Å¿o outragious, but civill, or rather Å¿ecure, who indeed never felt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Å¿uch trouble, and fight in them, any Å¿uch feare or terror, but all things is, and ever was at peace within, they are men voyd of true grace and Å¿aving grace; they may have the Å¿had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and Å¿imilitudes of grace, but no Å¿ubÅ¿tance and truth of it.</p>
                        <p>This may teach every man that hath this feare in him, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Æ²Å¿e </seg>2</label> to make much of it and nouriÅ¿h it, it being the forerunner of grace, and as it were the harbinger of it, without which it never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, as God never comes with grace, unleÅ¿Å¿e this apparitor go before; as men therefore who deÅ¿ire the Prince, and joy in his comming, will rejoyce at the comming of his Harbinger, and make much of him, Å¿o ought they of this feare; yea, and the greater this feare is, the more rejoyce at it, aÅ¿well as men may rejoyce in feare, for the greater grace follows after, for in the examples of the Scriptures, thoÅ¿e who have had moÅ¿t feare and conflicts in their converÅ¿ion, have been the beÅ¿t men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, moÅ¿t full of grace. God (Å¿aith <hi>Bernard</hi>) hath two feet, the one of feare, the other of love; and when he would enter a mans Soule, he is wont to Å¿end afore, or Å¿tep firÅ¿t in with his foot of feare, then after, his foot of love; and the greater the feare is, which went before, the greater the love is which follows after.</p>
                        <p>The third effect of this feare is, to make the party it poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿eth credulous, apprehending every Å¿urmiÅ¿e againÅ¿t him, making him encline to the worÅ¿t, and forecaÅ¿t the utmoÅ¿t of the evill. As in that feare which the Goaler was poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿t with, Acts 16.27. he apprehended the worÅ¿t and utmoÅ¿t. In Samuel and JoÅ¿iah, Å¿o in the Ninevites, Ion. 3.5. therefore it made them appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the worÅ¿t, and beleeve it would be Å¿o.</p>
                        <p>BecauÅ¿e feare brings to minde a mans Å¿innes and deÅ¿erts, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">ReaÅ¿. </seg>1</label> even thoÅ¿e which were long before committed, and for them makes
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:151759:72"/>him apprehend danger, and deeper then indeed it is. As in the brethren of <hi>JoÅ¿eph,</hi> Gen. 42.21. no marvell then, if it make them eaÅ¿ily beleeve that Å¿uch things may fall upon them.</p>
                        <p>BecauÅ¿e they know by themÅ¿elves, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">ReaÅ¿. </seg>2</label> that thoÅ¿e who are inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and offended, doe hate the offenders, and where hatred is joyned with power and might, there muÅ¿t needs be danger of Å¿ome fearefull effect, and Å¿o makes them Å¿uÅ¿pect the worÅ¿e; It is Å¿o betwixt man and man, Gen. 50.15. So betwixt man and God.</p>
                        <p>This teacheth us that undoubtedly there is a great want of this feare amongÅ¿t moÅ¿t, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Æ²Å¿e </seg>1</label> becauÅ¿e they doe not apprehend or beleeve the dangers imminent, or as great as they be; but if a little, yet they will not make the worÅ¿t, but the beÅ¿t of every thing. They read often the judgements of God written; they heare them threatned againÅ¿t particular Å¿innes, and it may be their owne; they Å¿ee them executed upon particular men daily, every moment, and every morning he drawes forth his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet they hang in Å¿uÅ¿pence, whether he will doe with them, as they Å¿ee him doe with others before them: They have the root of gall and bitterneÅ¿Å¿e, Deut 29.18, 19. How many Å¿coffers have we, who will not beleeve that Hell fire is Å¿o hot as the preacher tels them; no Hell but in this life, the gall of the conÅ¿cience, which they can cure with company, and good fellowÅ¿hip. How many have we that thinke the mouth of God is not Å¿o hot againÅ¿t Å¿inners as men Å¿peake of, not Å¿o grievous as we would make them beleeve; and though now and then Å¿ome be Å¿mitten, yet that he muÅ¿t for example Å¿ake, to keepe Å¿ome more orderly; but no great feare there needs be of it, Å¿o long as a man is not outragious? how many that think repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is not Å¿o difficult, as men would make it, for at their deaths for a little confeÅ¿Å¿ion and proclaiming of their Å¿orrow, they Å¿hall have a fellow pronounce pardon unto them; how many thinke that death is not Å¿o Å¿uddaine, and Å¿o uncertaine as Å¿ome imagine, few dye Å¿o, and that they need not much Å¿uÅ¿pect, and feare to be prepared, but they Å¿hall have time enough: And for a little good at their death, they heare many Preachers not tell of the Å¿innes of men in their lives, for that will not be born, but of their good at their deaths, and include every bodies Å¿oule in Heaven. But theÅ¿e men are all voyd of this feare, for if they had it, they would be eaÅ¿ily perÅ¿waded of theÅ¿e things in their Soules; yea, they would Å¿uÅ¿pect farre more then we could Å¿ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geÅ¿t, for Å¿o Å¿uÅ¿pitious is feare: and as every affection is prone to the apprehenÅ¿ion of thoÅ¿e things, that feed that affection; as love, joy, hatred, &amp;c. So Å¿pecially if feare.</p>
                        <p>Particularly, every man may try himÅ¿elfe, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Æ²Å¿e </seg>2</label> whether hee hath this feare or no. Is he like to the Å¿onnes in law of <hi>Lot,</hi> when
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:151759:73"/>their father told them how that God would deÅ¿troy Sodome, Gen. 19.14. <hi>Hee Å¿eemed to them as one that mocked;</hi> So when the MiniÅ¿ters threat particular or generall judgements, he is but as one that mockes, and becauÅ¿e of Gods patience after their Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and denouncing, thou thinkÅ¿t nothing will come; but Å¿ay, as Å¿ome have been heard Å¿peaking, the MiniÅ¿ters doe well to threaten Å¿harpely, and Å¿peake great words, and tell the people of fearefull things, but yet we hope for farre better things, feare thy Å¿elfe, becauÅ¿e thou canÅ¿t not feare the things they Å¿peak, and believe them, much leÅ¿Å¿e apprehend more, never caÅ¿ting the worÅ¿t, but making the beÅ¿t of every thing: this Å¿ecurity argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that thou wanteÅ¿t this Å¿ervile feare.</p>
                        <p>The fourth effect of this feare is humility; for feare beates downe the pride of the heart, and makes men not Å¿tand upon their pantofles, man to man, not to Å¿tand upon tearmes, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Benhadad</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 Kings 20.31, 32. Å¿o in this where the feare of Gods power is, the former examples of Ninevites, IÅ¿raelites, <hi>Saul, Goaler,</hi> Å¿heweth it plainly, as that Rom. 11.20. <hi>Bee not high minded, but feare:</hi> a proud Å¿pirit and the feare of God can never agree.</p>
                        <p>BecauÅ¿e they know there is no wiÅ¿dome nor power againÅ¿t the Lord, <label type="milestone">

As in <hi>Benhadad:</hi> Å¿o women and friends, who Å¿ue to Judges for their friends, doe petition them Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ely. <hi>ChryÅ¿oÅ¿tom.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BecauÅ¿e it will make every man out of love and liking with all things he hath, <label type="milestone">

                        <p>This, as the former, Å¿heweth that many men are deÅ¿titute of this feare, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Æ²Å¿e </seg>1</label> they are Å¿o highly minded, they Å¿tand Å¿o upon their tearmes, and prerogatives, in moÅ¿t things, not with men but God, not in Å¿mall things but matters of Å¿alvation. They Å¿tand upon their reputation and eÅ¿teem amongÅ¿t men, when as God cals up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Å¿ounds an Alarum, not to the eare by us, but to their heart and conÅ¿ciences with us, calling them out of their courÅ¿e of life, as their ambitious, lying, deceitfull, covetous or carnall, civill courÅ¿e, and Å¿ubmit themÅ¿elves to the word &amp; to the means of Å¿alvation, forÅ¿aking Å¿uch courÅ¿es, and living humbly, dealing plainly, walking contentedly, having religious and holy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ations, they fear men will mock &amp; Å¿corn at them, &amp; think mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of them, Å¿ay they are become Å¿uperÅ¿titious, or turned preciÅ¿e, or they cary themÅ¿elves otherwiÅ¿e then becometh men of their place and Å¿tate, like <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> Jer. 38.19. Like thoÅ¿e rulers, who
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:151759:73"/>beleeved on ChriÅ¿t, but of a proud and ambitious humour, they were aÅ¿hamed to profeÅ¿Å¿e him. John 12.42, 43.

How many have we like to theÅ¿e in all places, Cities, Townes, Villages, houÅ¿es, all full of them; as many as there are, Å¿o many have we, that yet have not this Å¿ervile feare.</p>
                        <p>Particularly, every man may try himÅ¿elfe whether he hath this feare or no: <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Æ²Å¿e </seg>2</label> where this <hi>Timor</hi> is, there is not <hi>Tumor,</hi> Å¿aith <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard;</hi> there this feare hath pierced that bladder, and let out all the wind in it; thou art growne humble and lowly, and Å¿tandeÅ¿t not upon the reputation or eÅ¿timation of men, Å¿o thou may'Å¿t doe what God commands when he calls to any duty; but if thou doeÅ¿t, there is no feare in thee. For inÅ¿tance, thou haÅ¿t in the time of thy ignorance or prophaneneÅ¿Å¿e, either when thou waÅ¿t a Å¿ervant, defrauded thy MaÅ¿ter to get a Å¿tock to Å¿et up by, as is the cuÅ¿tome of divers; or being free and in Trade, thou haÅ¿t deceived and defrauded many men, and the treaÅ¿ures of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneÅ¿Å¿e are yet in thy houÅ¿e. Thou comeÅ¿t to the Church, thou heareÅ¿t the Word, the Lord Å¿mites by the Å¿word of his mouth, and calls for this, that thou with Å¿peed make reÅ¿titution; thou wilt not doe it; why? thou Å¿tandÅ¿t upon thy credit; for if thou make open reÅ¿titution, then thou Å¿halt be accounted a fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and deceitfull man, and every body will caÅ¿t it in thy teeth upon any breach; if privately, thy credit will Å¿o Å¿inke, for thon art not able to drive a trade as before, and to maintaine thy Å¿elfe, wife, and children. Know this, thou art void of this Å¿ervile feare, while thine heart is Å¿o full of pride, that it will not Å¿toope to God and his commandement; for if thou fearedÅ¿t his power and juÅ¿tice, thou wouldeÅ¿t not Å¿tand upon this reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with men: Can he not make thy wickedneÅ¿Å¿e knowne to thy Å¿hame? and can he not make thee as poore to thy diÅ¿honour? If thou diddeÅ¿t feare this, thou wouldeÅ¿t never Å¿tand upon that. The like may be Å¿aid of men who make profeÅ¿Å¿ion of converÅ¿ion and Religion, and yet neglect the duties of it, for feare of the Å¿cornes and reproaches of men, and Å¿tand upon reputation; they have no feare. But if thou canÅ¿t be content to hazard thy credit to obey him, that gives credit, and honour, and riches to whom he will, and takes them from he pleaÅ¿eth; it will prove to thy Å¿elfe and to others that thou haÅ¿t this feare at leaÅ¿e, what elÅ¿e may be more; if not, then the contrary; for there can be no place for feare, where the heart is paÅ¿Å¿ed up with pride. To obey God in honourable things, and things to be done without

                        <p>The fifth effect of this feare is diligence and carefulneÅ¿Å¿e, that is, it will never let a man reÅ¿t, till he have uÅ¿ed all the meanes whereby he may have any hope to eÅ¿cape that which he is afraid of.

                        <p>
                           <hi>YEE offer uncleane bread upon my Altar.</hi>] Here is Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to their defence. They who offer polluted things to God, deÅ¿piÅ¿e his Name; but Å¿uch are you, for ye offer pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bread upon my Altar: where we muÅ¿t examine the Å¿enÅ¿e of three words: FirÅ¿t, Altar. Secondly, Bread. Thirdly, polluted or uncleane.</p>
                        <p>FirÅ¿t, by the Altar, there are Å¿ome, and not of the meaneÅ¿t, who underÅ¿tand in this place the table of Shew-bread that Å¿tood in the Temple and Tabernacle, juÅ¿t over againÅ¿t the CandleÅ¿tick on the North-Å¿ide, and the right hand of it. In the Tabernacle there were three diÅ¿tinct places; the Tabernacle, the holy place, and the moÅ¿t holy: The table of Shew-bread was in the Å¿econd, whither the PrieÅ¿ts onely came. By the Altar then is underÅ¿tood the Altar of burnt offerings, which Å¿tood in the outward Court, whither both PrieÅ¿t and people came, and had like acceÅ¿Å¿e when the Law was read, and their dayly Å¿acrifices were offered. And thus doth <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Cyrill</hi> underÅ¿tand it upon this place: Å¿o that we expound not this by that which is in the end of the VerÅ¿e, but that by this, becauÅ¿e we find in the Scripture the Table put often for the Altar, but not the Altar for the Table.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, by bread, Å¿ome underÅ¿tand onely the Shew-bread, as <hi>Hierome;</hi> Å¿ome, of bread which was offered with the burnt-offering on the Altar, Levit. 6.20. Numb. 28.6. Some, not of the bread onely, but of the fleÅ¿h alÅ¿o, or whatÅ¿oever thing elÅ¿e was offered there upon the Altar, which is the beÅ¿t accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; for the word here uÅ¿ed Å¿ignifies not bread alone, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o other victuall and meat, as it is uÅ¿ed in the word, and as <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill</hi> expoundeth this place, and Å¿ome other, for the bread of the Å¿acrifice; and eÅ¿pecially the Prophet himÅ¿elfe, <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 8. when he Å¿hews that he meant the Å¿acrifices and meat that was offered upon the Altar.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, by uncleane, what is meant; it is agreed of by moÅ¿t, that it is not any thing that is uncleane by nature, or naturally; that is, Å¿uch a thing as is abhominable to humane Å¿enÅ¿e, as Ezek. 4.12, 13. nor yet any thing that is uncleane morally: as all
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:151759:78"/>things are Å¿aid to be morally vile and polluted, that God doth diÅ¿allow and diÅ¿like of; <hi>Nullum cadaver tam foedumaut faetidum</hi> (as <hi>Gregory</hi> Å¿aith) to us, as the Å¿inners Å¿oule in the Å¿ight of God. But it is myÅ¿tically unclean, that is, in regard of Å¿ome myÅ¿ticall Å¿ignification, God having pronounced them typically unclean, to inÅ¿truct Å¿ome further matter, that thereby he would inure men the rather to abhorre them. And thus are all things Å¿aid to be unclean which are prohibited in the law ceremoniall; and Å¿o it is in this place. But theÅ¿e things were either unclean by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or of themÅ¿elves: in the firÅ¿t by touching a dead corps, or any uncleane thing; in the Å¿econd either in their kinde, as IÅ¿aiah 66.17. or in quality only, that is, when it comes by Å¿ome accident, of which, Deut. 17.1. of this is meant in this place, as the 8. verÅ¿e Å¿heweth.</p>
                        <p>And Å¿o here Å¿eemes to be a double fault taxed by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; one in the people, and the other in the PrieÅ¿ts; and Å¿o a double duty exacted of them; the peoples fault was in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of polluted offerings, and preÅ¿enting them unto the PrieÅ¿ts; their duty was to have brought Å¿uch as were Å¿ound, entire and perfect; the PrieÅ¿ts fault was in receiving them at their hands, and not reproving and prohibiting them; his duty was to have inÅ¿tructed them what Å¿acrifice they were to bring, and to reject that which was uncleane, and not according to the Law. Now theÅ¿e Å¿acrifices were to be cleane, and pure, and perfect, <hi>ad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum capitis,</hi> to Å¿hew the perfect purity of ChriÅ¿ts humane nature, 2 Cor. 5.21. 1 Pet. 1.17. Secondly <hi>ad typum corporis,</hi> to Å¿hew what they Å¿hould be who are members of him, and that offer theÅ¿e Å¿acrifices unto God; that they Å¿hould be <hi>perfect to every good worke,</hi> 2 Tim. 5. and Rom. 12.1, 3. So that then, beÅ¿ides that which hath been Å¿poken for the Å¿acrifice, we may gather out of the peoples fault, (comparing outward things with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,) the type with the truth, that Å¿eeing God reaÅ¿ons on this Å¿ort; if they who bring polluted offerings unto me, contemne me, then Å¿uch as come polluted in themÅ¿elves, much more.</p>
                        <p>They who come to the publique Å¿ervice of God, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                           </label> and come to offer him any Å¿acrifice muÅ¿t not be uncleane and polluted in their hearts and lives, but muÅ¿t come with holineÅ¿Å¿e and purity; for if their Å¿acrifice, muÅ¿t be Å¿uch, then themÅ¿elves; and the Å¿acrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were commanded to be Å¿uch, becauÅ¿e they themÅ¿elves ought to be Å¿uch. When God reproved IÅ¿rael for it, IÅ¿aiah 1. and 66.3. and Jerm. 7.9, 10. he Å¿heweth what he required of them, and of others; to this purpoÅ¿e is, PÅ¿al. 4.4, 5. Gen. 35.2. JoÅ¿hua. 24.16, 19, 23.</p>
                        <p>BecauÅ¿e God elÅ¿e will not accept their Å¿ervice; for he firÅ¿t looks to their perÅ¿on, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">ReaÅ¿. </seg>1</label> and then their Å¿ervice, Gen. 4.4. for the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:151759:79"/>Å¿acrifice doth not Å¿anctifie the perÅ¿on, but the perÅ¿on it: as <hi>Haggai.</hi> 2.13, 14. Proverb. 15.8.</p>
                        <p>BecauÅ¿e elÅ¿e that which God offers and gives to them, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">ReaÅ¿. </seg>2</label> is made hurtfull unto them; not that God gives any evill, but becauÅ¿e they are evill that receive it. As the Sacrament to <hi>Judas,</hi> ChriÅ¿t gave not that which was evill; nor did he, being the PhyÅ¿itian, give the poyÅ¿on; but <hi>Judas</hi> being wicked, it became evill unto him: for as the Å¿pyder and the adder turn good meat into poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on; and as a corrupt Å¿tomacke, abounding with choler and Å¿uch like, turneth the meat they eate into choler, and the finer the meat is, it is the Å¿ooner turned to corruption; Å¿o is it in this thing, Titus 1.15. <hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>To reprove all Å¿uch as have no care to purge and purifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves before they come unto the houÅ¿e of God, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Æ²Å¿e </seg>1</label> to his Å¿ervice; that come without repentance, without preparation, full of their drunkennes, whoredomes, uÅ¿uries, adulteries, and Å¿uch like Å¿innes. They are more guilty of contempt againÅ¿t the Lord, then if they withdrew themÅ¿elves altogether from his obedience and houÅ¿e. A man having committed Å¿ome offence againÅ¿t his Prince, &amp; being Å¿ummoned to appeare perÅ¿onally in his preÅ¿ence, if he refuÅ¿e to come at him, and Å¿hun his Å¿ight, may well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of contumacy, but not of contempt, for he may do it out of fear; and contempt and fear cannot Å¿tand together in one Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; but if he Å¿hall confidently come &amp; appeare before him, as if he had done no Å¿uch thing, or not offended him, Å¿hew no Å¿orrow for his offence, make no promiÅ¿e of amendement, nay Å¿hall rather Å¿tand in it, &amp; with an impudent face avow it, &amp; profeÅ¿Å¿e to perÅ¿iÅ¿t in it, this muÅ¿t needs be judged a groÅ¿Å¿e &amp; outragious contempt. Now the place of Gods worÅ¿hip is his preÅ¿ence, and he that commeth thither, commeth to look God full in the face; as <hi>Cain</hi> was caÅ¿t out from the <hi>face</hi> of the Lord. Gen. 4.16. If he come nor, he Å¿hall Å¿uffer as <hi>contnmax,</hi> as rebellious and diÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient; but he that commeth polluted, with the filth of his Å¿in unrepented of, with a purpoÅ¿e to perÅ¿iÅ¿t, he Å¿hall be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hed as a contemner. They who refuÅ¿ed to come were Å¿hut out, but he that came in his old cloathes, was bound hand and foot, &amp; caÅ¿t into utter darknes, Math. 22. he that is willfully abÅ¿ent, excluding himÅ¿elfe from the Å¿ociety of the Saints, in the time of grace, Å¿halbe barred their company in the time of glory for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; but he that preÅ¿umeth to appeare there, with the guilt of his Å¿inne on him, Å¿hall have a farre greater portion in Hell fire, he Å¿hall Å¿uffer as in caÅ¿e of contempt, like an inÅ¿olent rebell, that bourdeth his Prince to his face in his owne Palace; and in the mean time all their prayers are unaccepted, yea they are turned
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:151759:79"/>into Å¿inne to them, they obtaine nothing of God more then he would give them, though they never prayed, with which he feeds them but for the Å¿laughter; yea, and hence we profit not them by preaching, but make them worÅ¿e; wee are not the Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of life unto them, but of death by the word, they are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their Å¿ins, by this two edged Å¿word they are daily woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; becauÅ¿e their Å¿innes are not wounded, their perÅ¿ons are, and the more fearefully, becauÅ¿e their wounds are not Å¿enÅ¿ible; yea by the Sacraments the Devill, as upon <hi>Judas,</hi> Å¿o upon them, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth more Å¿ure poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion, and raignes in them.</p>

There was a Laver of braÅ¿Å¿e, Exod. 30.18, 19. for <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Å¿onnes to waÅ¿h in before they offered any thing at the Altar, to Å¿hew what we Å¿hould doe being made the Lords PreiÅ¿ts; to this <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> alluded, PÅ¿al. 26.6. <hi>I will waÅ¿h mine hands in innocency, O Lord, and compaÅ¿Å¿e thine Altar.</hi> And this ought we to doe, that our prayers may be heard and be acceptable, that our hearing and receiving of the Sacraments may be fruitfull unto us; elÅ¿e PÅ¿al. 66.18. <hi>If I regard wickedneÅ¿Å¿e in mine heart, the Lord will not heare me:</hi> and we being corrupt, this muÅ¿t needs be hurtfull unto us, unleÅ¿Å¿e we learne that wiÅ¿dome from the Serpent, to caÅ¿t our poyÅ¿on before we come to drinke.</p>
                        <p>Out of the peoples fault, (comparing outward things with inward, the type with the truth,) we have gathered, that the people that bring offerings to God, they who perform any Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to him, ought to be holy and pure; for if their Å¿acrifice, much more they. Now out of the PrieÅ¿ts fault we may gather, that if they ought to reject unclean and unfit Å¿acrifices, then thoÅ¿e alÅ¿o who brought them, being unclean; yet they ought to put a difference, and to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h betwixt the clean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, to receive the one, and refuÅ¿e the other, as Levit 10.10. And Å¿o from the proportion we may gather Å¿ome obÅ¿ervation for our times.</p>

And doubtleÅ¿Å¿e in this reÅ¿pect the mercy is more; for while that Å¿inne was prevented, more and, perhaps, greater Å¿innes were prevented in him. Men are nothing Å¿o Å¿enÅ¿ible in this, but it is their corruption; as they are not Å¿o Å¿enÅ¿ible of the benefit, being kept from tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ing the Law, as getting a pardon after; nor in preventing a diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving it after. But the merecy is great, whether it be by the voice of a MiniÅ¿ter, if he open his heart to it, or the voyce of a judgment, or the voice of his conÅ¿cience, or the voice of the Spirit, EÅ¿. 30.21.

Luke 16.10. <hi>He that is faithfull in the leaÅ¿t, he is alÅ¿o faiothfull in much; and he that is unjuÅ¿t in the leaÅ¿t, is unjuÅ¿t alÅ¿o in much.</hi> It is a Å¿ure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of an hypocrite, for a man to live apparently in the practice of any one known Å¿inne, though in other things hee Å¿eeme ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Å¿o Å¿trict. For EccleÅ¿. 10.12. <hi>Any one dead Fly corrupts the oyntment.</hi> But to condemne a man for an hypocrite, in being Å¿tricter than our Å¿elves in Å¿ome caÅ¿es, and for being nice in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Å¿mall moment; when the whole tenour of his life is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiÅ¿e righteous alÅ¿o, it is to condemne him for that which ChriÅ¿t will commend him for at the laÅ¿t, when no man Å¿hall take his praiÅ¿e or his joy from him, Matth. 25.21. But theÅ¿e men thus condemne themÅ¿elves; for as the Heathen <hi>

And Å¿o evill actions Å¿till argue an evill heart, as bad fruits an evill tree: And Å¿o it is a very ridiculous thing for men to brag of a Å¿ound and good heart, when their lives be as they bee.

If God Å¿end his meÅ¿Å¿engers and MiniÅ¿ters to us, bringing glad tidings of peace, thinke wee if the Prince Å¿hould Å¿end an AmbaÅ¿Å¿adour unto us with good comforts and great promiÅ¿es, how would we heare him, and Å¿trive to it; how uÅ¿e him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and reÅ¿pect, by no meanes deny him any obedience, much leÅ¿Å¿e abuÅ¿e him in word or deed? So for the MiniÅ¿ters, if they were Å¿ent from men to men, what faithfulneÅ¿Å¿e, care, and diligence would they uÅ¿e? Thinke when thou art to pray to God, how thou wouldeÅ¿t put up a petition to the Prince, with what Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion, reverence, attention, and humility. If thou art to come to his Table, and called to it, thinke how if the Prince called thee to his, thou wouldeÅ¿t remove impediments, Å¿et aÅ¿ide excuÅ¿es, come with all preparation as a gueÅ¿t fitting his Table. God requires Å¿ervice of thee as his Å¿ervant, thinke if thou wert the Kings Å¿ervant in ordinary, what wouldeÅ¿t thou doe for the time thy Å¿ervice is required: doe that, and wholly that, and little of thy owne, the moÅ¿t of the day Å¿pent in his: So thinke if thou beeÅ¿t Gods Å¿ervant, what is required of all the dayes of thy life; the chiefeÅ¿t and greateÅ¿t part of it. God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires almes and reliefe of thee, a portion for his Å¿ervants and houÅ¿hold, his Levites and MiniÅ¿ters, and the poore. Doe not uÅ¿e them as men doe the Kings takers, hide the beÅ¿t things from them, and thinke every thing too good; thou knoweÅ¿t he will not then accept thy perÅ¿on, but be angry with thee. So in this; Thou wilt Å¿ay many MiniÅ¿ters are wicked and unworthy, Å¿o thou maiÅ¿t Å¿ay of many takers and purveyours; yet if thou deny to them the Kings due, though they Å¿hall be puniÅ¿hed, yet Å¿halt thou be checked. So in this, looke to God, and not them.</p>

                           <p>And now, I pray you, pray before God, that he may have mercy upon us: this hath beene by your meanes: will he reward your perÅ¿ons, Å¿aith the Lord of HoÅ¿tes?</p>

                           <hi>AND now, I pray you, pray before God.]</hi> After the Prophet had reproved their Å¿innes, he comes to threaten them for them in the reÅ¿t of this Chapter: and theÅ¿e judgments or puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments threatened, may be reduced to theÅ¿e two heads; they are either privative, that is, a withdrawing of Gods mencies, <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 9. <hi>ad</hi> 14. or they are poÅ¿itive, an inflicting of a curÅ¿e, <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 14.

                        <p>In this VerÅ¿e is the rejecting of their prayers.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And now, pray.]</hi> This Å¿ome take to be an exhortation to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and to Å¿eeke the Lord; as <hi>Zephan.</hi> 2.3. but Å¿ome, and the moÅ¿t; underÅ¿tand this <hi>IronicÃ¨,</hi> by an <hi>Ironia,</hi> and thinke it is Å¿poken in deriÅ¿ion, like IÅ¿aiah 47.12. 1 King. 22.15 So here he commands nothing, but derides them who thought thus to reconcile God by Å¿uch Å¿acrifices: As if he had Å¿aid, Long may ye doe thus, but prevaile nothing at all.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pray before the Lord,]</hi> Some read, <hi>entreate the face of God,</hi> that is, the favor of God; for Å¿o is face taken for favor, PÅ¿al. 31.16. Å¿ome read, <hi>Pray to turne away the face of God,</hi> that is, his anger: as PÅ¿al. 34.16. Å¿ome <hi>before the Lord,</hi> to the Lord himÅ¿elf, or in the place where he Å¿heweth himÅ¿elf, Å¿eeking unto him by prayer, PÅ¿al. 27.8. And of theÅ¿e this is the moÅ¿t pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That be may have mercy upon us,]</hi> He alludeth, as it is thought, to that, Numb. 6.35. <hi>(.i.)</hi> that he would be gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull unto us, forgive us our Å¿innes, and multiply his mercies and bleÅ¿Å¿ings upon us, (upon us) Prophet and people: the Prophet putteth himÅ¿elfe amongÅ¿t the reÅ¿t, as partaker of the Å¿ame miÅ¿eries and troubles.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>This hath been by your means,]</hi> Now the Prophet laieth upon the PrieÅ¿ts the cauÅ¿e of this curÅ¿e that is befallen the people: Å¿ome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre this to the former part, Å¿hewing that they Å¿hould pray, becauÅ¿e they had been in fault. It is true that they ought chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿t to Å¿eeke to turne to God, that are authors of his wrath; But
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:151759:98"/>then Å¿hould this be taken by way of exhortation, not upbray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. But this is referred of Å¿ome to the latter, Å¿hewing the reaÅ¿on why God will not heare nor accept, becauÅ¿e they are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this evill, and therefore unfit to pray to God for the reÅ¿t. This hath been by your meanes, by your fault hath this evill happened untous; for it is not Å¿o much the fault of the people, who bring Å¿uch imperfect Å¿acrifice to the Temple, as yours who receive them for gaine, and neither reprove the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of the people, nor inÅ¿truct their ignorance, as by your office you ought.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Will he]</hi> That is, he will not; the Interrogation denies more Å¿trongly.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Regard your perÅ¿ons]</hi> will he accept your perÅ¿ons and faces? To accept ones face is to Å¿hew himÅ¿elfe courteous and gracious to any.</p>
                        <p>He will give to none of you, nor accept your prayers. That which was Å¿poken cloÅ¿ely by an Ironie, and carried the face of a permiÅ¿Å¿ion or command, that is now plainly and without figures Å¿poken, Å¿hewing that he rejected both them and their Å¿acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Saith the Lord of HoÅ¿ts]</hi> He that made all in Heaven and Earth, and is ruler over all creatures, the mighty Lord. As it were to meete with the bÅ¿e conceit they had of God, preferring every meane man before him.</p>
                        <p>In the firÅ¿t place, of this covert rejecting of their prayers; and firÅ¿t of the manner, then the matter. The manner is an ironicall Å¿peech, or Å¿peech of deriÅ¿ion.</p>
                        <p>It is lawfull for the MiniÅ¿ters of God, <label type="milestone">

                           </label> and for holy men to uÅ¿e Ironies, that is, Å¿coffing Å¿peeches, deriding taunts againÅ¿t the wicked: For Å¿o is it here by the Prophet. So <hi>Elijah.</hi> 1 Kings 18.27. <hi>And at noone</hi> Eliiah <hi>mocked them, and Å¿aid, cry aloud, for he is a God; either he talketh, or purÅ¿ueth his Enemies, or is in his journey, or it may be that he Å¿leepeth, and muÅ¿t be awaked.</hi> EccleÅ¿. 11.9. IÅ¿aiah 44.12, 13, &amp;c. 1 Kings, 22.15. Now examples are warrants, where precepts be not againÅ¿t them.</p>
                        <p>BecauÅ¿e this is a Å¿peciall meanes, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">ReaÅ¿. </seg>
                           </label> as to Å¿hew a mans dereÅ¿ting of Å¿uch things, Å¿o to draw them to the diÅ¿liking of Å¿uch things as they are affected with or dote upon: Å¿uch Å¿peeches often more prevaile, then greater matters, men being more impatient of aÅ¿coffe, then many Å¿erious reproofes.</p>
                        <p>This refelleth their conceit, who deny any uÅ¿e of theÅ¿e things, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Æ²Å¿e </seg>1</label> they deny there are any Å¿uch things in the Scripture, they Å¿ay they are lyes: they Å¿ay that the ApoÅ¿tle forbids them, <label type="milestone">

                           </label> Neither are they Å¿uppoÅ¿ed unfitting the MajeÅ¿ty of the Scripture: For though it
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:151759:99"/>be true that a man Å¿peakes one thing and thinkes another, yet the manner of his words and Å¿peech doth bewray his minde, and that indeed there is no contrariety; for the hearer may eaÅ¿ily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cern his minde. As in that of <hi>Michaiah,</hi> 1 Kings 22.15. for verÅ¿e 16. <hi>Ahab</hi> diÅ¿cerned well his meaning, that he did but Å¿coffe at him and his falÅ¿e Prophets; Å¿o that he Å¿peakes as he thinkes, not for the very words, but for the matter of the words. Neither makes the place in the EpheÅ¿ians againÅ¿t this, becauÅ¿e it forbids Å¿currility, when men Å¿coffe and reproach others raÅ¿hly, when there can be no edifying of others, or good to the party, but their malice and diÅ¿daine Å¿hewed, and as well the modeÅ¿t and temperate hearers, as the Å¿ufferers are offended; which is that which differeth farre from theÅ¿e things; we can not bring theÅ¿e within compaÅ¿Å¿e of a lye unleÅ¿Å¿e we make the Spirit of truth a lying Spirit: And in theÅ¿e a man hath no intent to have his words otherwiÅ¿e taken then he meaneth them.</p>
                        <p>This warranteth the uÅ¿e of them, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Æ²Å¿e </seg>2</label> as Å¿ometimes our men have done in deriding and Å¿coffing at the folly of PapiÅ¿ts, at their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols and Idolatrous Å¿ervice, and fooliÅ¿h Å¿uperÅ¿titions; and ever are lawfull to be uÅ¿ed, when a man doth it not for revenge, or to wreck his anger &amp; wrath upon Å¿ome perÅ¿on that is his particular enemie, but to reprove and condemn impious and idolatrous worÅ¿hip and Å¿uch like.</p>
                        <p>Now for the matter, and firÅ¿t for that which is general here in the whole, God will not accept their prayers, that is the thing threatened.</p>
                        <p>It is a heavy thing, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>
                           </label> and fearefull judgement, that men Å¿hould pray and not be heard, that they make long prayers to God, but he will be as though he heard not, but reject their Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, and they be as men beating the ayre. It is threatned here: So IÅ¿aiah 1.15. <hi>And when you Å¿hall Å¿tretch out your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you, and though you make many prayers, I will not heare: for your hand are full of blood.</hi> Proverb. 1.28. <hi>Then Å¿hall they call on me, but I will not anÅ¿wer: they Å¿hall Å¿eeke me earely, but they Å¿hall not finde mee.</hi> HoÅ¿ea 8.13. The contrary is promiÅ¿ed as a bleÅ¿Å¿ing, and performed as a bleÅ¿Å¿ing, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as a bleÅ¿Å¿ing. IÅ¿aiah 30.19. <hi>Surely a people Å¿hall dwell in Lion, and in JeruÅ¿alem: thou Å¿halt weep'no more: he will certainly have mercy upon thee, at the voyce of thy cry; when hee Å¿peaketh he will anÅ¿wer thee,</hi> 2 Chron 7.14. PÅ¿al. 116.1, 2.</p>
                        <p>BecauÅ¿e it is a manifeÅ¿t Å¿igne that the perÅ¿ons are out of favor, and he is diÅ¿peaÅ¿ed with them: <label type="milestone">

It is that they grieve for, becauÅ¿e they receive not from God, but never that their prayers are not received of God; like him that puts up a Petition to the Prince, and is little or not at all troubled that he reads it not, but gives it over to another that will Å¿mother it; but his griefe is, that he relieves him not; and this appeares, becauÅ¿e their hearts deÅ¿ire any meanes elÅ¿e, though never Å¿o unlawfull, to Å¿upply that they want, and to give that which God will not grant; and if the opportunity be offered, they will not Å¿tick to uÅ¿e them: as <hi>Saul</hi> did the witches, things condemned by him before. Secondly, becauÅ¿e if thoÅ¿e meanes be of force, and by them they prevaile, their hearts are cheared up well enough, little or not at all Å¿orrowing that he heard them not, not much caring though he did not.

Therefore if thou haÅ¿t oppreÅ¿Å¿ed, or wronged, or defrauded any by any meanes, make him reÅ¿titution to the full; and if thy ability be Å¿uch, more than full, and of the reÅ¿t give to the poore, and to good uÅ¿es: for if thou thinkeÅ¿t the giving of theÅ¿e will excuÅ¿e thee to the Judge for the other, thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveÅ¿t thy Å¿elfe; it were as if a Theefe, being arraigned for a robbery, Å¿hould thinke to anÅ¿wer the Judge, and eÅ¿cape Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death, becauÅ¿e he gave much of it to the next poore he met: Å¿o in this; for the Lord hates robbery for a burnt offering, and if thou wouldeÅ¿t have a bleÅ¿Å¿ing, EccleÅ¿. 11.1. <hi>CaÅ¿t thy bread upon the waters,</hi> and leave it to be imployed lawfully, though leÅ¿Å¿e benefit come to the poore, and a Å¿horter time, not by that which is odious to God and man; for an UÅ¿urer is a reproach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t men, God caÅ¿ting that Å¿hame upon him; for how canÅ¿t thou anÅ¿wer ChriÅ¿t at that judgment, how thou haÅ¿t left thy goods?</p>

Matth. 5.33. But if not the Å¿inne, yet the curÅ¿e, and to avoid it, make good that thou haÅ¿t Å¿poken to God. I Å¿uppoÅ¿e many men in the time and heate of the Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e vowed great things to God, if they were preÅ¿erved, and if God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne in mercy to the City, that they might in Å¿afety follow their callings againe; for I cannot thinke but that moÅ¿t men, Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when God came any thing nigh them, were affected and touched for the preÅ¿ent, which uÅ¿ually brings forth Å¿uch thoughts and Å¿uch motions. If any were not, I think their caÅ¿e is marvellous fearefull, to be in the fire, and no relenting. Then you that did, remember your vowes, and Å¿ee where is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them; it may be Å¿ought for, but not early Å¿eene, or Å¿een in a very few: And what is to be expected but theÅ¿e curÅ¿es, and more heavy than we have had? If your children or Å¿ervants, all the time you are correcting of them, and holding the rod o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, promiÅ¿e to learne their books better, and doe their worke more diligently, whereupon you Å¿pare them; if they after deale deceitfully with you, will not your diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure be doubled, and your anger be increaÅ¿ed, and you thinke law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully too? thinke Gods waies are more equall and juÅ¿t. If thou wouldeÅ¿t avoid this, then doe as <hi>David</hi> Å¿aid, and did; PÅ¿al. 66.13, 14. <hi>I will goe into thine houÅ¿e with burnt offerings, and I will pay my vowes which my lips have promiÅ¿ed, and my mouth hath Å¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in my affliction.</hi> If a man vow when he is in cuÅ¿tody or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿traint, that when he getteth liberty, he will goe and dwell in a place where the Word is; if the Word goe from thence, he is not bound, Ruth 1.16, 17.

In the body, for the health of it, men can endure not only preÅ¿cription, but application of PhyÅ¿icke; yea, of Å¿harpe, bitter, and biting things. If they Å¿end for a PhyÅ¿itian who feeles their pulÅ¿e, diÅ¿cerneth their urine, and conceiveth of their diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, and yet fall onely to diÅ¿courÅ¿e of the excellentneÅ¿Å¿e of PhyÅ¿icke, and other diÅ¿eaÅ¿es, and never come any thing to theirs at all, they would happily judge him a great Scholar, but no wiÅ¿e man, nor fit for a PhyÅ¿itian; and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily call in queÅ¿tion his fidelity.

The PhyÅ¿itian that will preÅ¿cribe, and Å¿ee his patient take it, and come to Å¿ee how it workes with him, is much commended for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿ty, care and fidelity: But if the MiniÅ¿ter do the like, he is buÅ¿ie and medling; but he that will pleaÅ¿e men, is not the Å¿ervant of ChriÅ¿t: and theÅ¿e muÅ¿t know, when he deales with their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Å¿innes, out of a generall text, he hath his warrant enough, Å¿uch as Å¿hall acquit him.</p>

The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters application may diÅ¿charge himÅ¿elfe, but not profit them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿Å¿e they will apply and keep it. The Patient, if he take not, and endevour to keep the potion preÅ¿cribed and brought, by Å¿melling of vinegar, or the like, labouring againÅ¿t the bad humours of the Å¿tomacke, Å¿hall have little profit by the PhyÅ¿ick, but rather hurt: So it is in this, they muÅ¿t heare all, and labour to retain all; but learne that eÅ¿pecially which concernes themÅ¿elves, places and conditions. One man Å¿hould not Å¿o greedily receive that which toucheth another man, and let paÅ¿Å¿e that which is to him; or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that to others which is to himÅ¿elfe, but every man that which is for himÅ¿elfe.

So with theÅ¿e: <hi>Abraham</hi> obeyed God to go out of his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey when God called him, not objecting the inconveniences, Gen. 12.4. And when to offer up <hi>IÅ¿aac,</hi> not objecting, as he might if he had conÅ¿ulted with fleÅ¿h and blood, infinite things againÅ¿t it. Gen. 22. Hereto is that, Exod. 34.23.24. Levit. 25.20. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat. 1.16.</p>
                        <p>BecauÅ¿e all inconveniences in the world, <label type="milestone">

As if theÅ¿e can excuÅ¿e a man when he Å¿hal come before the Judge,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151759:135"/>or he Å¿hall not be Å¿tript naked of them all, and be left alone to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wer for his diÅ¿obedience. Men are taught they ought to deale plainly and truly with others in weight and meaÅ¿ure, to Å¿peake truth, and not to lie, and Å¿uch like: They Å¿ee then they Å¿hall not grow rich as others, and be eÅ¿teemed of as others, as they think; and therefore they chuÅ¿e rather by Å¿uch meanes to grow rich, then to obey God: as if their comming into the world was onely to get riches, and not to honour and obey God. Teach them to be liberall unto the poore for good cauÅ¿es, and to make them friends with the riches of iniquity, Luk. 10.9. and that God will give them uÅ¿e for it: They will anÅ¿wer or thinke as the widow of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repta did, 1 Kings 17. they have little enough for themÅ¿elves and theirs, and they feare to want before they die, or not to leave enough for theirs. As if that they left behinde them were theirs, and not rather that they Å¿ent before. As Princes have more uÅ¿e of that they Å¿end by their Harbingers, then of that they leave in their Å¿tanding houÅ¿es: Å¿o Å¿hould they have more profit by that they give before, then that they leave behinde. PerÅ¿wade them to make reÅ¿titution of that they have wrongfully taken from men, or elÅ¿e God will not juÅ¿tifie them but condemne them, Micha 6.10.11. They Å¿ee they Å¿hall call their names in queÅ¿tion, they pretend Å¿landering of the GoÅ¿pel. To theÅ¿e I Å¿ay, <hi>Saul</hi> diÅ¿obeyed God, as he pretended to Å¿acrifice to God, or to have that he might, and not for private uÅ¿e; but it excuÅ¿ed him not, he loÅ¿t his kingdome for it: let them take heed they loÅ¿e not the kingdome they Å¿ay they hope and look for.</p>
                        <p>To teach every man when he hath a commandment of God, <label type="milestone">

He that obÅ¿erveth the winde, Å¿hall not Å¿ow; and he that regardeth the clouds, Å¿hall not reap: he Å¿hall neither Å¿ow any obedience, nor reap any reward. If he Å¿ee no inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience imminent, and obey, it is not much worth: for he pleaÅ¿eth himÅ¿elfe rather then God; but if there be, it is the more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. As diÅ¿obedience in Å¿mall things is more offenÅ¿ive, becauÅ¿e the obedience was eaÅ¿ie: Å¿o obedience in great things, and when there are great inconveniences, is more acceptable, becauÅ¿e it is harder.

The affirmative inferres the negative. Heret belongs that, Numb. 1.51. and 16.10. and 4.15.20. Ezra 2.62.63. Heb. 5.4. This made the ApoÅ¿tles ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch their calling, Gal. 1.1. Jam. 1.1. Pet. 1.1. Hereto is that Rom. 10.15. There are three kindes of callings, when men are called by men, and not by God, as firÅ¿t, all teachers: Secondly, of God by MiniÅ¿tery of the Word, all ordinary MiniÅ¿terie: Thirdly, by ChriÅ¿t immediately, as ApoÅ¿tles, Gal. 1.1. The firÅ¿t to be abhorred, the third to be admired, the Å¿econd to be expected of all in an ordinary planted Church, Rom. 10.15. The calling is double, or hath two parts; the firÅ¿t inward ability for gifts, and aptneÅ¿Å¿e for minde, willingneÅ¿Å¿e and abilitie. The Å¿econd is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the calling by man, and the Church. Hereto belongs the deÅ¿criptions of a BiÅ¿hop and MiniÅ¿ters, Å¿et out by Saint <hi>Paul</hi>

For if this be Å¿ound and true, that muÅ¿t needs be falÅ¿e and corrupt, that any Å¿hould take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of this calling, without warrant from God, and beÅ¿ides the order that God hath appointed. Yet I deny not but there is a difference where a Church is not yet planted, where every one that knowes ChriÅ¿t may preach him, and labour to gaine others that are ignorant of ChriÅ¿tian religion, and are not to look for an ordinary ordination. For then is he choÅ¿en by the Å¿ilent Å¿uffrages and voices of thoÅ¿e who heare, and that is his calling; yet is he not to refuÅ¿e the ordinary calling, if after it be to be had. But when a Church is already planted, and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed; becauÅ¿e all things muÅ¿t bee done in order, then is required an apparent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination by voyces or impoÅ¿ition of hands; that trouble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuÅ¿ion might be avoided. Neither do I deny, but Å¿ometime there is an extraordinary function, as were the Prophets, not of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viticall Å¿tocke, not ordained of the PrieÅ¿ts, which God Å¿tirred up, when ordinary MiniÅ¿ters could not reforme the corruptions of the time; but what he did extraordinarily, is to be admired rather then imitated: For we muÅ¿t follow the preÅ¿cript rule that is given us, which is, that every man have his ordinary calling which is from God by men.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The law of truth was in his mouth, and there was no iniquity found in his lips; he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>THe law of truth was in his mouth.</hi>] Here begins the Å¿econd reaÅ¿on given of the Lord, why he would bring theÅ¿e judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:151759:151"/>upon theÅ¿e PrieÅ¿ts; namely, their diÅ¿Å¿imilitude with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and firÅ¿t PrieÅ¿ts, with whom he made the covenant, and to whom he did performe it, <hi>Aaron, Eleazar, Phineas.</hi> And in this the order obÅ¿erved is, he Å¿etteth downe in the firÅ¿t part of the compariÅ¿on, their good and worthy parts which were the prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ors, verÅ¿. 6. and the reaÅ¿on of it, verÅ¿. 7. There are foure worthy parts reckoned of theirs. And theÅ¿e were not of private and particular parts, as they were private men; but they were Å¿uch parts as were in them as publicke perÅ¿ons: As if it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the former, he Å¿aid, he did not onely carry himÅ¿elfe and approve himÅ¿elfe a good and godly man; but he Å¿hewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe a wiÅ¿e and compleat Doctor, both in teaching the Law and Truth of God, and giving moÅ¿t wiÅ¿e, grave, and wholeÅ¿ome counÅ¿ell.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The law of truth was in his mouth.]</hi> The firÅ¿t part of the prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ors, which was commendable in them, he was ever moÅ¿t Å¿tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious of the law of God, and moÅ¿t skilfull in it, and taught it moÅ¿t Å¿incerely to his people, ever teaching moÅ¿t Å¿ound doctrine to them, that they might obÅ¿erve my precepts.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And there was no iniquity found in his lips.]</hi> The Å¿econd thing commendable; he never propounded or taught any errour, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deceived any of my people to draw them from my true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip; but taught ever that which was wholÅ¿ome and good. Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is commonly taken for the pervertion and depravation of the knowne right, and is oppoÅ¿ite to equity and truth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>He walked with me in peace and equitie.]</hi> The third thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; the Å¿umme of it is, he lived and performed the duty of his place without all negligence &amp; unfaithfulneÅ¿Å¿e, approving himÅ¿elfe to God and men. He walkes with me, i. he was moÅ¿t carefull to pleaÅ¿e me, and to approve himÅ¿elfe unto me, to worÅ¿hip me as I required, and followed not the wickedneÅ¿Å¿e of the age, nor was corrupted with the depravations of the time, whereby men were depraved in my Å¿ervice and feare, as Gen. 5.22.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In peace.]</hi> That is peaceably, not provoking me to anger; but cleaving faÅ¿t unto me, and obeying my will, Å¿o that I had no cauÅ¿e of expoÅ¿tulating or quarrelling with him. <hi>Cyril</hi> Å¿aith, To have peace with God, is nothing elÅ¿e but to deÅ¿ire to know and do that which God requires, and to offend him in nothing.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And did turn many from iniquity.]</hi> The fourth thing commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable in them, was, that by their exact walking, and faithfull tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, they helped to turne others from their Å¿infull wayes. Out of the coherence, that from their perÅ¿onall and inherent vertues, he proceeds to the vertues of their place, and their publicke acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and carriages; we may note:</p>
                        <p>It is not enough for a man to be honeÅ¿t and good in himÅ¿elfe, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                           </label> in his owne perÅ¿on; but if he have any place, either more or leÅ¿Å¿e
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:151759:151"/>publicke, he muÅ¿t be good &amp; faithfull in that, if hee would be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of God: As if he be a MagiÅ¿trate, or MiniÅ¿ter, or officer, or maÅ¿ter of a family. As this is manifeÅ¿t in the coherence: Å¿o by that, Gen. 18.17.18.19. &amp; Exo 18.19.20.21. Hence is both the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations &amp; blemiÅ¿h of old <hi>Eli,</hi> he was a good PrieÅ¿t, a good Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trate, but a bad father; in the more publicke, good; in the leÅ¿Å¿e, defective, 1 Sam. 1.2. Hence we read in Scripture, the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of good governours, and Kings, both for their private parts, and their publicke vertues: In themÅ¿elves fearing God, and in publick diÅ¿charging their duties Å¿ufficiently and faithfully. And in the new TeÅ¿tament we finde not onely private and perÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall duties preÅ¿cribed to MaÅ¿ters, Fathers, Husbands, to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters and MagiÅ¿trates; but Å¿pecially publicke, EpheÅ¿. 5. and 6. Col. 3. and 4. 1 Tim. 3.2. &amp;c. Tit. 1.6. Hence the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Angell of the Church of EpheÅ¿us, though he was defective in perÅ¿onall, Rev. 2.2. and the reproofe of the Angell of Pergamus, verÅ¿es 14.15.</p>
                        <p>BecauÅ¿e he more glorifies God: for though his good workes, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">ReaÅ¿on </seg>1</label> as a private man, do glorifie God; yet nothing Å¿o much as his faithfulneÅ¿Å¿e in his place publicke, which makes that God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified much more, and of more. An annuall MagiÅ¿trate may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the glory of God more in that yeare, then in all his life: not onely becauÅ¿e <hi>Regis ad exemplum, &amp;c.</hi> but becauÅ¿e they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and compell moe.</p>
                        <p>BecauÅ¿e this will blemiÅ¿h the other their private parts, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">ReaÅ¿on, </seg>2</label> and bring Gods judgements upon them, at leaÅ¿t temporall, as in <hi>Eli,</hi> and the Angel of Pergamus.</p>
                        <p>This may let all thoÅ¿e Å¿ee their errour and corruption, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Æ²Å¿e </seg>1</label> who take places, or Å¿eek them only for the honour and dignity of them, without either ability for the duties, or conÅ¿cience and care to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme thoÅ¿e publicke duties, onely it Å¿ufficeth them that they have Å¿ome faith and feare of God, as other private men have, and never Å¿hew themÅ¿elves faithfull in their publicke places, never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to doe and execute the places. But of few fathers of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies can God Å¿ay as of <hi>Abraham;</hi> nay, he knowes the contrary, that they tooke the place with no minde to do any Å¿uch dutie, and Å¿o execute it Å¿till. So of MagiÅ¿trates and MiniÅ¿ters. They are brought, or thruÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, before they be called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Å¿tage of the world; and when they are on it, do no more then make a dumb Å¿hew, perform no more then lookers on, or but things that muÅ¿t be done of courÅ¿e, and would be though they Å¿lept: which is the fault not onely of men profane, or but civilly honeÅ¿t; but of men who profeÅ¿Å¿e the feare of God; and may well be thought to have Å¿ome good meaÅ¿ure of it, and go for good and truly honeÅ¿t men. Yet it is their blemiÅ¿h, that they are careleÅ¿Å¿e of the duties of their place. That as he Å¿aid, An evill man may be a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:151759:152"/>good Citizen: we may Å¿ay, Good men are evill Citizens, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters, &amp;c. which blemiÅ¿heth much their private graces in the Å¿ight of God and good men. And upon many hath, and doth, and will bring particular and temporall judgements, from their families, and Å¿ervants, &amp;c. For this is a grand cauÅ¿e why good men, fathers of families, have Å¿uch graceleÅ¿Å¿e children, and corrupt Å¿ervants, MiniÅ¿ters Å¿uch untoward flockes, MagiÅ¿trates Å¿uch people.</p>
                        <p>This may admoniÅ¿h and inÅ¿truct all that have the faith and feare of God, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">VÅ¿e </seg>2</label> to joyne with it this care of the duties of their place whatÅ¿oever it is; that they muÅ¿t have, becauÅ¿e theÅ¿e duties though they be profitable for the common good, yet are they not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table from him. As he Å¿aith, <hi>CyprianÅ¿ec. de zela &amp; livore,</hi> that performeth holy things and is not a conÅ¿ecrated PrieÅ¿t, doth things in reÅ¿pect of himÅ¿elfe, childiÅ¿h and unprofitable though they may be good to others. So he that doth things without faith and the feare of God, they are unprofitable; yea wicked and damnable Å¿innes, howÅ¿oever they may benefit others; Å¿o may I Å¿ay of theÅ¿e; but yet this had, will not beare out, nor excuÅ¿e the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and not doing the duties of his place. It may make the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of them paÅ¿Å¿ed over, but not defend the omitting of them. Therefore to be accepted of God, men muÅ¿t alÅ¿o be carefull of that: MaÅ¿ters, &amp;c. The excuÅ¿es that commonly are pretended will not goe for currant; Å¿ervants will not abide with me, if I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truct, correct, and reÅ¿traine them, as duty and reaÅ¿on requireth. FirÅ¿t, Å¿ee whether thou art not the cauÅ¿e why they are Å¿o untracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, either not Å¿eeking by prayer a bleÅ¿Å¿ing upon thy government, or dealing hardly and paÅ¿Å¿ionately in thy government, as if thou hated them, rather then loved good things, or thy Å¿ervants Å¿ee thee doe contrary to that thou directs them; for if none of theÅ¿e, God will perÅ¿wade them to be tractable and bend their hearts, or elÅ¿e know that he would have thee purge thy houÅ¿e of them, as <hi>David</hi> Å¿aid and did his, of his Å¿aid lewd Å¿ervants; leÅ¿t as God proÅ¿pers a bad houÅ¿hold for a good Å¿ervant, Å¿o he curÅ¿e a good houÅ¿hold for a bad Å¿ervant. MiniÅ¿ters excuÅ¿es of the untractableneÅ¿Å¿e, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneÅ¿Å¿e of their people which may happily come from their former negligence, or indiÅ¿cretion; or if God doe not bleÅ¿Å¿e his labours to them, his reward Å¿hall be never a whit the leÅ¿Å¿e, nor he leÅ¿Å¿e acceptable, Å¿o he doe his duty. MagiÅ¿trates and Officers, that they Å¿hall be accounted buÅ¿ie, officious, and pragmaticall, and it may be when they are out of their office they Å¿hall have actions againÅ¿t them for this and that uÅ¿age; they may happily be juÅ¿tly Å¿o accounted, becauÅ¿e they follow and doe things in humour not in conÅ¿cience. If they doe not, they neede not doubt of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and of good Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e, and Å¿hould rather feare an action from God then men, beÅ¿ides the loÅ¿Å¿e of the good they may have by doing it. But to all I Å¿ay as Å¿he Å¿aid to the Heathen King, <hi>doe me
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:151759:152"/>juÅ¿tice, or elÅ¿e ceaÅ¿e to be my King.</hi> So let them either doe the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their places or elÅ¿e never take them, or Å¿peedily give them over, and leave to be maÅ¿ters, &amp;c. Or elÅ¿e they muÅ¿t know that if God will not juÅ¿tifie; he will condemne.</p>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:151759:153"/>to teach it, cap. 4.2. To deliver the whole counÅ¿ell of God.

If any Å¿ay, they are not able to conceive, and are not capable of it: I anÅ¿were, their children at firÅ¿t are not capable of all the learning the School-maÅ¿ter can teach them; yet at length, and by Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e and progreÅ¿Å¿e, he learnes as much as he can teach him, and is fit for a higher Schoole: So may it be with them.

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Æ²Å¿e </seg>3</label> and the MiniÅ¿ters of it, are Å¿o harÅ¿h and Å¿o unacceptable unto moÅ¿t men, if they be faithfull, and will Å¿eeke by all means to convert men to God; becauÅ¿e they muÅ¿t turne them from their Å¿in, Å¿eparate them and their iniquities, which they love Å¿o dearly, as Micha 6.7. Sin is either naturall, or by cuÅ¿tome, or both; naturall diÅ¿eaÅ¿es are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t incurable, and no leÅ¿Å¿e diÅ¿eaÅ¿es that grow into a cuÅ¿tome, which is another nature: And the PhyÅ¿itian that Å¿hould go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to cure theÅ¿e againÅ¿t a mans will, Å¿hould have little thanke for his paines, and be not greatly welcome, when Å¿uch things cannot be removed without moÅ¿t Å¿harp and bitter medicines, great paine and griefe: So in this. And here is the cauÅ¿e why many a mans miniÅ¿tery at the firÅ¿t comming to a place, is very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable for a while, becauÅ¿e he Å¿peakes things good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ome, but Å¿omewhat generally, becauÅ¿e he knowes not the Å¿tate of his flocke and people: but after he hath lived Å¿ome yeares, and Å¿ees their Å¿innes, and begins to Å¿peake home unto them; then is he unacceptable, becauÅ¿e he would part them and their Å¿ins. As that MiniÅ¿ter that Å¿hould perÅ¿wade a divorce betwixt a man &amp; his wife which he loves moÅ¿t dearly, Å¿hould never be welcome to his houÅ¿e or company: Å¿o in this. It may be it is but the Å¿ame he hath
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:151759:157"/>often Å¿poke of before, but then it was borne; becauÅ¿e they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably conjectured, he meant not them, but when he hath been a while with them: that it is like he may know them to be guilty of that Å¿inne, though happily, and ten to one, he did not, then is it tolerable, becauÅ¿e they thinke he would Å¿eparate them and their beloved Å¿inne, their profitable and delightfull Å¿inne. All the while he will preach peace and comfortable things to them, and bring the word of reconciliation, and tell them of Gods love, and Gods mercie, and that he is Å¿ent to wooe them to be married to God: all that while he Å¿hall be kindly welcome. As he that Å¿hould Å¿ue for a Prince, to win the love of a woman to him, all the while he tells of his honour and riches, and beauty, and Å¿uch things, he Å¿hall be kindly welcome: but if he come to tell her, that Å¿he muÅ¿t Å¿eparate her Å¿elfe from Å¿ome place and company Å¿he loves well, and change her manners, and forÅ¿ake her friends and fathers houÅ¿e; he Å¿hall finde his entertainment, both for uÅ¿age and countenance, changed: So in this. Which makes oftentimes MiniÅ¿ters, if they be not the more faithfull, grow cold and careleÅ¿Å¿e, and Å¿o fall into many grievous Å¿ins.</p>

But the Scripture is manifeÅ¿t, that both particular PrieÅ¿ts, and generall Councels of PrieÅ¿ts have erred. In general are theÅ¿e, IÅ¿aiah 59.10. Jerem. 6.13. and 14.14. which places Å¿hew, that the moÅ¿t of the PrieÅ¿ts and Prophets were then corrupt. Now if there Å¿hould have been a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell gathered of theÅ¿e, what good might be hoped for from them, by going to the Councell; they might have changed their places, but not their mindes; they would have been the Å¿ame in a Councell they were at home. BeÅ¿ides, is it not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿t, that Councels have erred? 1 Kings 22. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> happily will anÅ¿were, they were a Councell of Prophets, not PrieÅ¿ts, gathered by the King, not the high PrieÅ¿t. Then Å¿ee a Councel of PrieÅ¿ts ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by the high PrieÅ¿t erring, John 9.22. and 11.53. and Mark 14.64.

Their pretences they hold forth in their defence, are vaine: FirÅ¿t, they can read at home, and it may be, better Sermons then he they Å¿hould heare, can preach any. Let me grant them they can; yet followes it not they will: for he that accounts little of Gods publicke ordinance, will hardly performe any Å¿uch private dutie, mans nature being more apt to publicke then private duties. But Å¿ay they can, and will, and doe it, yet is it faultie, becauÅ¿e it is croÅ¿Å¿e to Gods commandment, who could as well have commanded private at that time, as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke. And though it be in it Å¿elfe good, yet being out of it fit time, it is evill. It is good and lawfull for a man to follow his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or to build Churches, or to get in his harveÅ¿t, or to recreate himÅ¿elfe in their times; but to do theÅ¿e upon the Lords day, is evill. As in the body, the bloud, that is the continent of life, is good, Å¿o it be in the proper veÅ¿Å¿els, the veines: but if out, it is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and breeds putrifactions and diÅ¿eaÅ¿es. And as all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are good in their proper place, but one in another is mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trous, and hurtfull, as the finger upon the hand, and in the eye: Å¿o it is of theÅ¿e things.

                        <p>Thirdly, you cannot prove we ought to heare Å¿o often. Thou muÅ¿t learne and heare from him the whole Law of God, which cannot be heard in a mans life in Å¿o Å¿eldome hearing, as they can bee content onely to hear, and much leÅ¿Å¿e learned. If they muÅ¿t heare out of Å¿eaÅ¿on, then oftner then they would, or do. But Å¿hall I tell you the true cauÅ¿e of this refuÅ¿all? It is either pride of heart, whereby they are puffed up with their owne knowledge, and condition, and thinke they know as much and need no more, and are, as the Å¿peech is, as well as meat can make them; which is plain hypocriÅ¿ie: or it is pride of Å¿tate, when they are puffed up with their wealth and Å¿tate, and thinke it enough for the poore to receive the GoÅ¿pell, and preÅ¿Å¿e upon it. It is not for their Å¿tate and worÅ¿hip to be over attendant, to Å¿trive and thirÅ¿t after the Word, they come more to honour the Word, or to be well thought of by men, then for any good they look to receive by it; which is a Å¿pice of AtheiÅ¿me: or it is becauÅ¿e of the guilt of their conÅ¿cien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who finde the galling of the Word, who thinke if they Å¿hould continually heare it, they Å¿hould have no quietneÅ¿Å¿e in themÅ¿elves at all, when they can hardly quiet themÅ¿elves that heare Å¿o Å¿el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which is carnall Å¿ecurity; or elÅ¿e he that hath them in a Å¿nare at his will, is afraid to loÅ¿e them: And when he findes that one Sermon makes <hi>Agrippa</hi> almoÅ¿t a ChriÅ¿tian, he is afraid of a conÅ¿tant hearing, leÅ¿t they Å¿hould become ChriÅ¿tians altogether, and he be caÅ¿t out, knowing the Preacher is the power of Å¿al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

BeÅ¿ides that was then Å¿ayd, I Å¿ay, let them Å¿ee if this be not to check the wiÅ¿edome of God, who hath written both, and preÅ¿erved the whole to the Church; and if pride did not tranÅ¿port them beyond themÅ¿elves, it could not be they Å¿hould be Å¿o affected. As wiÅ¿edome would teach them that many things are neceÅ¿Å¿ary, though not the preÅ¿ent profit of them appeare. For as in inÅ¿truments onely the Å¿trings Å¿ound, yet are there other things in the whole body, as that whereunto they are tied, the bridge, the pinnes, which help the muÅ¿icke: Å¿o in the Prophets, though all be not propheÅ¿ies, yet they are things to which theÅ¿e are tied and illuÅ¿trated. <hi>Aug de Civ. D. lib.</hi> 16.2. And Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for thoÅ¿e things which Å¿ignifie Å¿omething, are thoÅ¿e things which Å¿ignifie nothing added. As the ground is onely plowed and rent up by the plow Å¿hare, yet that this may be, other parts of the plow are neceÅ¿Å¿ary. And humility, if they had any, would teach to Å¿uÅ¿pect their owne wiÅ¿edome, in not Å¿eeing the uÅ¿e and end, the profit and fitneÅ¿Å¿e of things, rather then queÅ¿tioning and reaÅ¿oning againÅ¿t God. Others can be content to heare all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ant things, as the promiÅ¿es and mercies of God, but judgements and reprooÅ¿es, threats and checks, that they cannot brooke; like unto thoÅ¿e, who in medicines affect onely the Å¿mell or trimneÅ¿Å¿e, or gayneÅ¿Å¿e of them, as pills rouled in gold, but cannot away with the force of purging and preÅ¿erving. And Å¿ee not that a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany more go to hell by preÅ¿uming in their lives, then by deÅ¿pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at their deaths. Some can willingly heare that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes other men, and their Å¿innes, their lives and manners, but nothing touching themÅ¿elves at all, and their owne Å¿innes: As men can willingly abide to heare of other mens deaths; but cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide to heare of their owne. Oftentimes they will make the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ter to beleeve as they did, Jerem. 42.5.6.7. Then they Å¿aid to <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> The Lord be a witneÅ¿Å¿e of truth and faith between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the Lord thy God Å¿hall Å¿end thee to us, whether it be good or evill, we will obey the voyce of the Lord God, to whom we Å¿end thee, that it may be well with us, when we obey the voyce of the Lord our

And indeed it is fearfull: for it argues, he was either an hypocrite before, or elÅ¿e by reaÅ¿on of Å¿ome Å¿ecurity and careleÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e over his own Å¿pirituall eÅ¿tate, he is fallen into a Å¿piritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all diÅ¿eaÅ¿e and Å¿ome Å¿ins he had not before; and refuÅ¿ing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies or the bitter potion which Å¿hould recover him, he muÅ¿t needs putrifie more. The body that is Å¿icke, and the part that is wounded, if either the remedy be rejected, or the Å¿alve be pulled off when it is applied, will doubtleÅ¿Å¿e grow worÅ¿e. As he that is Å¿ore Å¿icke, and grievouÅ¿ly wounded, gives hope of his recovery, while he will Å¿ubmit himÅ¿elfe to his PhyÅ¿itian, and take whatÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he preÅ¿cribes him: but he that is but a little ill, and refuÅ¿eth to hearken or receive any thing, gives no hope at all, though his hurt be the leÅ¿Å¿e: So in this.

As alÅ¿o by their wicked example they were the cauÅ¿e of the fall of many; that is, that many have Å¿inned, and were not puniÅ¿hed, as the word Å¿ometime Å¿ignifies.

Therefore reproves our Prophet theÅ¿e PrieÅ¿ts. To this purpoÅ¿e is that Heb. 6.12. and 13.7. and 12.1. inferred upon the 11. and Jam. 5.11. Hence was the commendations of <hi>IehoÅ¿aphat,</hi> 1 King. 22.43. and of <hi>IoÅ¿iah,</hi> 2 King. 22.2.

If the Prophet forbid us to follow our fathers, if they are condemned for following their fore-fathers, as did all the Kings of IÅ¿rael.

Rom.</hi> 4.4. For Councels, that a generall Councel may erre, if the Pope do not confirme it. <hi>Ibid.</hi> 4.3. And <hi>Ã¨ contra Idem de Conc. author</hi> 2.2.5. But if all be true that we have Å¿hewed, he may erre. But <hi>Bellar. de Pontif Rom.</hi> 4.3. proveth he cannot: for Luke 22.32. <hi>I have prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not,</hi> and Å¿o for the Pope, and Å¿o he cannot erre. It is anÅ¿wered: FirÅ¿t, that by faith is not heere meant an hiÅ¿toricall faith, but a juÅ¿tifying faith; not a generall faith, but a particular; nor that by which we beleeve God, but in God: which fails not by errour, Å¿o it be not fundamentall: for Å¿o Å¿hould we condemne all who ever have lived: But when a man doth fall wholly from grace, and ceaÅ¿eth to be a member of ChriÅ¿t. And that it is Å¿o, appeares out of the drift and Å¿cope of our Saviour ChriÅ¿t. for his drift was to arme and protect <hi>Peter</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t that triall and temptation that he then foretold him of: not againÅ¿t errour in teaching the Church, but againÅ¿t ApoÅ¿taÅ¿ie in time of triall. Therefore Å¿aith <hi>Theophilact in Lucam,</hi> he Å¿heweth him the particular temptation: for our Saviour would not arme there where he was not to be hurt, where there was no danger: not put an helmet upon the head when the heart and breaÅ¿t was to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:151759:164"/>be Å¿trucken. And thus much <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeÅ¿Å¿eth, when he makes <hi>Peters</hi> fall to be a matter of fact, to caÅ¿t utterly off his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer profeÅ¿Å¿ion, and not of faith; and therefore it was perÅ¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the habit of juÅ¿tifying faith, not infallibility in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of hiÅ¿toricall faith that ChriÅ¿t prayed for; which Å¿o differs, that a man may have the one, that is, juÅ¿tifying faith, and yet hold an errour not fundamentall to the death, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> contends for the Fathers, divers of them. And the other, that is a right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of the generall points of religion, and yet not have juÅ¿tifying faith, nor Å¿aving and Å¿anctifying grace, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> contendeth the Pope cannot erre, and yet confeÅ¿Å¿eth he may want Å¿aving grace.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it is anÅ¿wered, that that he prayed for here, was a thing not proper to <hi>Peter,</hi> but common to all the ApoÅ¿tles, yea all the elect; and if the gift and grace be common to all, and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, Joh. 17.9.10.20. by the Å¿ame perÅ¿on in effect the Å¿ame for all: upon which ground the ancient Fathers apply this place to all the ApoÅ¿tles; yea to all the elect: and if to all, then helps it them but a little.</p>
                        <p>The Å¿econd proofe he cannot erre, is Matth. 16.18. The gates of hell Å¿hall not prevaile againÅ¿t the Church: whence they firÅ¿t reaÅ¿on, that the foundation and roofe of the Church cannot erre: Å¿uch as <hi>Peter</hi> and the Popes his Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ors. I Å¿ay nothing that it is not yet proved, that the Pope is <hi>Peters</hi> Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿or: nay, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿t, that he Å¿ucceeded rather <hi>Simon Magus</hi> then <hi>Simon Peter.</hi> But I Å¿ay, that <hi>Peter</hi> is not the rocke. In the words, Å¿aith <hi>AuguÅ¿tine,</hi> there is difference betwixt <hi>Petrus</hi> and <hi>Petra,</hi> both in the Greeke and Latine. Againe, the rocke here is not <hi>Peter,</hi> but ChriÅ¿t, 1 Cor. 10.4. and 3.11. whereunto agrees the Fathers, and their owne writers, &amp; alÅ¿o late writers; whereby all colour of argument taken from this place for the Pope, is utterly quaÅ¿hed. But grant that they begge: then muÅ¿t it either be in regard of his perÅ¿on; but that cannot be: for the Church cannot be builded upon fleÅ¿h and bloud; Or in regard of Å¿ome Å¿uperioritie and place above the reÅ¿t. But as that cannot be proved: Å¿o the contrary is manifeÅ¿t, 2. Cor. 12.11. Or of his doctrine taught by him, and of the faith of ChriÅ¿t confeÅ¿Å¿ed by him, and Å¿o it is true. Now this was common to him and all the reÅ¿t. For as <hi>Iohn</hi> is called a Pillar, Gal. 2.9. Å¿o was <hi>Iames</hi> as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> and all the reÅ¿t, as Revel. 21.14. To which is that, EpheÅ¿. 2.20. with whom the Prophets are joyned, becauÅ¿e they writ the Scriptures, which is indeed the foundation of our faith; they being put for their writings.

                           <hi>Have we not all one father?</hi>] Some underÅ¿tand theÅ¿e words with the next verÅ¿e, as if it were a reaÅ¿on Å¿poken in the defence of their taking of Idolatrous wives, by them who had done it; their reaÅ¿on is thus: That Å¿eeing that they had all one father, which was <hi>Adam,</hi> and all one Creator, which was God: there was no reaÅ¿on why they Å¿hould not marry with them. But others doe underÅ¿tand them as two main reaÅ¿ons againÅ¿t their marrying them, urged by the Prophet from God himÅ¿elfe: and Å¿o the expounding of the words will rather confirme, and the greater conÅ¿ent of the learned old and new, goe that way. <hi>Hierom</hi> Å¿aith that the people being returned out of captivity, the Princes and PrieÅ¿ts, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple put away their wives of the IÅ¿raelites kindred, which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on of their poverty, and injury of the long way, and weakeneÅ¿Å¿e of their Å¿exe, impatiently bearing the labour, were waÅ¿ted, and became both infirme and deformed in body; whereupon they matched with Å¿trangers, who were freÅ¿h in yeares, beautifull and comely, the daughters of rich and mighty men; as we may Å¿ee in the ninth of <hi>Ezra,</hi> that is with the Canaanites, Hethites, Phere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ites, JebuÅ¿ites, Ammonites, &amp;c. Therefore they thinke the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet here reproves them; firÅ¿t for their marriages, and after for their divorces, VerÅ¿e 16.</p>
                        <p>There are two Å¿peciall and chiefe cauÅ¿es of love and good will amongÅ¿t men; the one is kindred, affinity, or conÅ¿anguinity; the other is one and the Å¿ame Å¿ociety of religion. FirÅ¿t, nature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells men to affect and love earneÅ¿tly thoÅ¿e who are borne in the Å¿ame family, deÅ¿cended from the Å¿ame parents and Å¿tocke; which bond cannot be violated or broken off without great wickedneÅ¿Å¿e. Secondly, men reaÅ¿onable and wiÅ¿e, do thinke thoÅ¿e Å¿pecially to be affected by them, who are companions with them in the Å¿ame religion and worÅ¿hip. And though this is the moÅ¿t worthy and Å¿ure, yet the other goes before, and firÅ¿t carries Å¿way with men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e it is by nature bred with them, and continued from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie. And theÅ¿e two they are here preÅ¿Å¿ed withall, as thoÅ¿e which condemnes their fact, dealing thus to put away the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of IÅ¿rael, the worÅ¿hippers of the true God, and to take unto them the daughters of the heathen, worÅ¿hippers of the falÅ¿e Gods. For the firÅ¿t of theÅ¿e reaÅ¿ons, it is here Å¿aid, <hi>Have we not all one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> That is, are we not all men and women deÅ¿cended from <hi>Abraham</hi> by one <hi>IÅ¿aac,</hi> from <hi>IÅ¿aac</hi> by one <hi>Iacob?</hi> Why then Å¿hould we thus doe? diÅ¿miÅ¿Å¿e thoÅ¿e, or paÅ¿Å¿e them over, and joyne our Å¿elves to the kindred of the heathen and Å¿trangers? And for the Å¿econd he Å¿aith, <hi>Hath not one God made us?</hi> Do we not all acknowledge one God the Creator, and worÅ¿hip and Å¿erve him
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:151759:173"/>with dutie? Do you diÅ¿miÅ¿Å¿e thoÅ¿e wives, who acknowledge the Å¿ame Creator with you, and worÅ¿hip him, and take unto you thoÅ¿e who worÅ¿hip Idols for him, and put their truÅ¿t in them? To create, or the Creator, is not here taken in that common Å¿enÅ¿e, as when we Å¿peake of Gods creation of the world: for then could this be no reaÅ¿on againÅ¿t, but rather for them, as Å¿ome would make it a reaÅ¿on in that Å¿ort which the Prophet laboureth to confute. But this being againÅ¿t them, muÅ¿t not be taken in that Å¿enÅ¿e, but in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Å¿enÅ¿e, as there is a Å¿peciall uÅ¿e of it in the Scripture, when it Å¿peaketh and dealeth of Å¿ome new &amp; Å¿ecret diÅ¿poÅ¿ition of things, as Jer. 31.22. And Å¿o it is uÅ¿ed, IÅ¿aiah 65.18. of Å¿uch a Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall creation is it here meant, where love and dutie is Å¿pecially due unto thoÅ¿e, who are of the Å¿ame religion with us, who follow the lawes and Å¿tatutes of the Å¿ame Creator and Author.</p>

                           <hi>And breake the covenant of our Fathers.</hi>] Some thinks that this is applied unto the Å¿econd reaÅ¿on; becauÅ¿e the covenant of the Fathers was, That they all, and their whole poÅ¿terity, Å¿hould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and worÅ¿hip one God onely: and one people Å¿hould be conÅ¿ecrated to one and the Å¿ame God. Others thinke, by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is meant the Law of God, a thing uÅ¿uall in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that Law which God gave unto our Fathers, that they Å¿hould not take the daughters of a Å¿trange God to wife, or of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nation.</p>
                        <p>Others thinke the reaÅ¿on Å¿tands thus; making a third reaÅ¿on of it; becauÅ¿e God, when he made covenant with the IÅ¿raelites, did it not with thoÅ¿e more then with theÅ¿e, with one more then with another, but with all alike: Å¿o that they who deÅ¿piÅ¿e others, violate the common covenant, as if it were onely a covenant made with them.</p>
                        <p>The concluÅ¿ion of all is thus framed: If you be all one in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Å¿oule, and by Law, why do you contemne one another?</p>

And Å¿o is this againÅ¿t
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:151759:176"/>charity, though helpfull to thy neighbour, in whoÅ¿e favour it is told.

Now then, though a man may helpe his brother and neighbour with the loÅ¿Å¿e of his goods and hinderance that way, but not neceÅ¿Å¿ary with the hazard of his life at all times, but never with the hazard of his Å¿oule, as every lyer Å¿hall doe.

Again, I anÅ¿wer, it is very hurtfull, and againÅ¿t charity: for though it be not againÅ¿t the profit of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, yet is it againÅ¿t publique charity: for uÅ¿ury is many waies noyÅ¿ome to the common wealth, as is eaÅ¿ie to be Å¿hewed.

LaÅ¿tly, it is againÅ¿t love we owe to our owne Å¿oules; for whoÅ¿oever putteth out to uÅ¿ury, or taketh increaÅ¿e, he Å¿hall not live, but dye the death, Ezek. 18.13. But for the benefit of the borrower, if it Å¿ometimes Å¿o fall out by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, and his paines and hazard, that is no thanke to the lender: for it is without all queÅ¿tion, he never intendeth it, though he may Å¿ometimes pretend it, and Å¿o though it might make it no Å¿inne in it Å¿elfe, yet that makes it Å¿inne to him: for gaine the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower or not, he will have Å¿ecurity for his principall and gaine, and an abÅ¿olute covenant, and makes no proviÅ¿ion for the borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers indemnity, for he will have it, loÅ¿e he or gaine he, all is one to him. And Å¿o it falleth Å¿ometimes out againÅ¿t charity, but if not it is ever againÅ¿t charity in them. <hi>Calvin,</hi> who is much pretended for the defence of this: and indeed, upon Ezek. 18. Å¿aith, that a man may in Å¿ome caÅ¿es take uÅ¿ury, and cannot preciÅ¿ely be condemned for it: yet in the Å¿ame place he Å¿aith apertly, we muÅ¿t alwaies hold it to be a thing Å¿carcely poÅ¿Å¿ible, that he which taketh uÅ¿ury, Å¿hould
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:151759:177"/>not wrong his brother. And therefore it were to be wiÅ¿hed that the very name of uÅ¿ury were buryed and utterly blotted out of the memory of men; but howÅ¿oever it may be profitable, and as they thinke Å¿o agreeable to charity; yet it is unjuÅ¿t in it Å¿elfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the law of juÅ¿tice, then the rule holds, Rom. 3.8.</p>

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">VÅ¿e </seg>3</label> or when they are about to doe any thing, to examine it whether it be lawfull or good, not by the event and fruit which may follow of it, or hath; but by the law of God how agreeable it is to it, and how profitable it is, or may be, nor how it is fallen out for Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but how lawfull and warrantable by the word: for a man may profit another and gloryfie God by that for which he may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. As in <hi>Iudas</hi> and the Jewes. If then a man hath done any thing and it is fallen out to the profit of man, and to the glory of God; it is never a whit better for him, unleÅ¿Å¿e he finde the thing he hath done to be agreeable to the word of God; for if he have done evill and good come of it, it is no thanke to him, but to the providence of God who Å¿o diÅ¿poÅ¿ed it. So if a man be about to doe any thing, if not agreeable or repugnant to the word, he muÅ¿t not think it good &amp; lawfull for to be done, becauÅ¿e he Å¿ees it may profit man or honour God, as if he had need of his lyes and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull actions; neither if he be to doe that which is agreeable, he muÅ¿t not thinke he muÅ¿t abÅ¿taine and not doe it, onely becauÅ¿e he doubts of the conÅ¿equent of it, but that is lawfull and which he muÅ¿t doe by his place that he ought to doe, and leave the other to God; for not the effects make a thing good, but the ground of it; not the fruit makes a tree good, but the roots of it. A man may Å¿poyle a good action agreeable to the word by his corrupt end, affection, or defect of faith; but he can never make it good, by them nor any thing elÅ¿e, if it be not with that agreeable.</p>

The Å¿inne is, that they have married with the daughters of Idolaters: the heynouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e of which Å¿inne is amplified from the perÅ¿ons, as that it is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:151759:177"/>Judah which hath done this evill, whom he had choÅ¿en before all the world; and Å¿pecially reÅ¿erved to himÅ¿elfe in the defection of the ten Tribes, they whoÅ¿e name is <hi>Faithfull,</hi> is become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull, from whom no Å¿uch thing was expected, that they Å¿hould doe Å¿o, yet they had tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ed. From the Å¿ubject. In IÅ¿rael among that people, whom the Lord hath enriched and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with Å¿o many bleÅ¿Å¿ings and benefites. In JeruÅ¿alem, in the place which he choÅ¿e to place his Sanctuary, which was the Kings Å¿eat, and mother Citie; whence whatÅ¿oever comes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pietie and honeÅ¿ty, or the contagions of vice and iniquity, may and will eaÅ¿ily Å¿pread themÅ¿elves abroad. For the thing, it is called an abomination; that is, Å¿uch an evill as the LOrd abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. Abomination generally is taken for any thing that is done againÅ¿t law and right, againÅ¿t Å¿ome ancient decree, or the cuÅ¿tome of lawes and manners. As generally, Gen. 46.34. Hence in Scripture is this word Abomination uÅ¿ed Å¿o much, when it Å¿pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of mixing of Å¿eed, when caution is had, left any thing be done but that which is right and lawfull.</p>
                        <p>It is amplified further, becauÅ¿e they have <hi>polluted Gods Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e.</hi>] By holineÅ¿Å¿e is here meant that holineÅ¿Å¿e which was in this people, becauÅ¿e they were dedicated to God, and the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Lord, and his owne proper people, gotten and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaÅ¿ed to himÅ¿elfe; which holineÅ¿Å¿e they had violated, in that they had mixed themÅ¿elves with Å¿trange women. Thus <hi>Hierom</hi> expounds theÅ¿e words, and it is moÅ¿t like to be the meaning: for Å¿o is it taken, PÅ¿al. 114.2 <hi>Iudah was his Sanctuary,</hi> or <hi>holy place:</hi> That land was dedicated to God, and poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of God, and by that is made holy; and there he exerciÅ¿eth his power by directing and governing them as his owne people, and thoÅ¿e who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to him.</p>

Phil. 3.19. So theÅ¿e were not true Gods, nor no Gods indeed, but Å¿o accounted of. And this name is communicated to them. <hi>Origen. hom.</hi> 14. <hi>in Numeros,</hi> hath this rule, That whereÅ¿oever the name <hi>Iehovah</hi> is, there is meant the true God, the creator of the world; but the

                           </label> all and every one, is an abomination to the Lord, that which his Å¿oule loathes, hates and abhorres.

Deut. 20.18. Hence he Å¿peaketh of particular Å¿innes, as Prov. 11.1. and 12.22. Rev. 2. Hence he is Å¿aid to abhorre the man that is wicked: not that he doth his perÅ¿on, as he is his creature, which he loves, but as hee hath made himÅ¿elfe Å¿uch, PÅ¿al. 5.6.</p>

As in a land and Å¿tate, when the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trates will not puniÅ¿h, then God will goe the circuit, and hold an AÅ¿Å¿ize, and bring his plagues and judgements upon them; but when they doe, it is an explication of his wrath: Å¿o in a particular man, which is a little world, a little countrey.</p>

But to unfold this as I thinke more fully, I would demand this queÅ¿tion, whether if one of the parties fall after the marriage into hereÅ¿ie? whether Å¿tands the marriage good? or whether ought there to be a divorce? PapiÅ¿ts generally thinke there Å¿hould be a divorce <hi>Ã  Thoro, non Ã  vinculo,</hi> a divorce unknowne to the Scriptures. <hi>CeleÅ¿tinus</hi> thought <hi>Ã  vinculo,</hi> though <hi>Innocentius</hi> was much againÅ¿t him.

For if the JuÅ¿tices at the SeÅ¿Å¿ions Å¿hould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme throughly, and deliver the goale every one to his Å¿everall puniÅ¿hment, the Judges Å¿hould have little cauÅ¿e to ride circuit, or if they did, but to make Å¿hort ones. So if MagiÅ¿trates, God would not puniÅ¿h, or if he did, yet not Å¿o long as three yeares famine, and three yeares peÅ¿tilence: So that of all the enemies of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth none is Å¿o great as remiÅ¿Å¿e, careleÅ¿Å¿e and corrupt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giÅ¿trates; for they are a cauÅ¿e of Gods generall judgements, when as their Å¿everity would prevent. And none Å¿uch a fore-runner of Å¿ome generall judgement, as they and their remiÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e; and in a MagiÅ¿trate, it is better for the generall good, that he be too Å¿evere puniÅ¿hing Å¿ome he ought and might Å¿pare, then remiÅ¿Å¿e paÅ¿Å¿ing by others that deÅ¿erve it. As a Surgeon better too deepe or too nigh, then too little in tenting or cutting.</p>

If any man thinke I Å¿lander them, becauÅ¿e they talke much of pennance and confeÅ¿Å¿ion and Å¿uch things; I anÅ¿wer, I doe not; to inÅ¿tance in one: The Å¿choole-men teach that Å¿alvation is in the Å¿acrament or Å¿acrifice of the maÅ¿Å¿e, as health is in a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, which cures though the party doe nothing to helpe, never beleeve, only receive it. They teach then that theÅ¿e reconcile without repentance. I deny not that our latter PapiÅ¿ts, when they find things written, Å¿canned, and Å¿o prove Å¿candalous, they have helped things with their late expoÅ¿itions; but it is one thing what they are forced to Å¿ay by argument, another thing what they commonly teach to the people, who have the one taught to them without the other.

If the body be to be cured, if any thing be brought unto them, they enquire who ever uÅ¿ed it, and what effect it had with them; and if they heare of many who did uÅ¿e it, and none ever recovered by it, they will never truÅ¿t to it; and yet for the Å¿oule they will go contrary. But if theÅ¿e doe not appeaÅ¿e him, why are they commanded, or why is that? Heb. 13.16. <hi>To doe good, and diÅ¿tribute, forget not: for with Å¿uch Å¿acrifices God is well pleaÅ¿ed.</hi> I anÅ¿wer, they are commanded for other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿es, as duties and teÅ¿timonies, and Å¿ignes of thankfulneÅ¿Å¿e: for it followes not that there is no uÅ¿e of them, unleÅ¿Å¿e this be; God ordained them for other purpoÅ¿es. And as it is in Å¿alves, they cure that they were ordained for, Å¿aith <hi>ChryÅ¿oÅ¿tome.</hi> For the Å¿alve for the eye cannot cure the cut of the hand. And for that, <hi>Do and live,</hi> that is underÅ¿tood of the whole and of perfect doing, which is impoÅ¿Å¿ible for any, becauÅ¿e of their weakneÅ¿Å¿e, Rom. 8. And that of the Hebrewes doth not tell us that that doth appeaÅ¿e God, when he is angry, but that they pleaÅ¿e him after he is appeaÅ¿ed, and reconciled: for then he accepts them graciouÅ¿ly and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably.

But when a man lies in his Å¿inne, and Å¿o purpoÅ¿eth, and is without faith and without ChriÅ¿t, all the Å¿acrifices of Å¿uch a wicked man are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination to the Lord; more when they are offered with a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked minde, of deÅ¿erving at his hands, and derogating from ChriÅ¿t, and making him to juÅ¿tifie the wicked.</p>

Therfore they now condemne this in us as the counÅ¿ell of <hi>ConÅ¿tance</hi> condemned <hi>Iohn HuÅ¿Å¿e</hi> and burnt him. But this, neither any the like place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futeth that we hold, who doe not deny that wicked men and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates may be of particular Churches, but not of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique; of particulars, becauÅ¿e to be in a particular Church is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elÅ¿e, but for a man to joyne himÅ¿elfe in that Å¿ociety, which profeÅ¿Å¿eth true religion. But to be of the Catholique Church is to be joyned to ChriÅ¿t as his member, and to draw life from him; Å¿o that he doth not, neither can periÅ¿h, In a particular Church then may wicked and reprobates be, as bad humours and rotten mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are in the body, but not in the Catholique Church, which is ChriÅ¿ts body; which as his naturall body could not Å¿ee corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, neither can it have any Å¿uch corrupts parts, and as no part of it could be cut off, no more of this; for where the head is, there Å¿hall all the members be, whereas then they Å¿hall never come where ChriÅ¿t is, they cannot be members of him, and Å¿o no parts of the Catholique Church. But are they not parts of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar? they are; but yet it followes not that every one in them is part of it; for as every ward or Å¿treete of London is part of the whole, yet followes it not that every one in them is part of it, for forrainers and Å¿trangers may be in it. There is none of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, but he either is or hath beene in Å¿ome viÅ¿ible and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church; yet it followes not that all that are in it, are of it. And by this may be anÅ¿wered all thoÅ¿e parables and other places they bring out of the Scriptures to prove that wicked men are of the Catholique Church, for they are all underÅ¿tood of particular Churches, where the wicked are mixed inÅ¿eparably with the good, as Chaffe is with the Wheate in the field and barne, as Lees with the Wine, in the TerÅ¿e and HogÅ¿head; yet is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Chaffe Wheate, nor the Lees Wine, neither they the Church.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>And this have ye done againe, and covered the Altar of the Lord with teares, with weeping, and with mourning: becauÅ¿e the offering is no more regarded, neither received acceptably at your hands.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>AND this have ye done againe.]</hi> The Prophet proceedeth to a Å¿econd Å¿inne in this people and to reprove it, going from their Å¿trange wives, to their having of many wives, to multiplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them which is reproved in this verÅ¿e and 14. and 15. Of the whole we have two parts: 1. his reproofe, 2. his exhortation to the contrary, <hi>fine v.</hi> 15. In the reproof as the vice is checked, but not Å¿o openly as the former, yet neceÅ¿Å¿arily out of the 15. verÅ¿e it followeth, that the grieving of their wives was by taking other wives to them. Now the amplification of this Å¿inne, or the hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouÅ¿eneÅ¿Å¿e of it, is Å¿et forth two wayes: FirÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e it was injurious to their wives and themÅ¿elves, verÅ¿e 13. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e it was againÅ¿t the inÅ¿titution and ordinance of God, verÅ¿e 14.15. Now the firÅ¿t againÅ¿t their wives, becauÅ¿e they grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and vexed them, and againÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, becauÅ¿e they made their own offerings to be rejected of the Lord.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And this have ye done againe.]</hi> And this Å¿inne have you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited in the Å¿econd place which comes here to be reproved a mongÅ¿t theÅ¿e particulars, you have taken not onely Å¿trangers but you have joyned them to your lawfull wives and taken them with them, and made them to mourne and weepe</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And covered the Altar of the Lord with teares.]</hi> The IÅ¿raelites women or their owne proper and lawfull wives, finding that they tooke others to them, and finding them in their places where they ought to have beene, and who had onely the right unto them, they wept day and night before the Altar of the Lord, as it were accuÅ¿ing his providence, that he did not releeve, and redreÅ¿Å¿e their injuries.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ye have covered.]</hi> He accuÅ¿eth not thoÅ¿e who did weepe, but thoÅ¿e who were the cauÅ¿e of their weeping.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ye have covered.]</hi> That is, you have made your wives by your carriage and dealing towards them to cover. So <hi>Cyrill</hi> interpreteth theÅ¿e words; and that both becauÅ¿e the place muÅ¿t needs have it Å¿o interpreted, as alÅ¿o from a common and uÅ¿uall kinde of Å¿peech. For when we doe any thing compelled or drawne to it, either by Å¿ome vehement love or hatred, or pitty of any man, or by Å¿ome other affection, he is Å¿aid to doe it by affection of whom we are compelled or drawn to it. As if a man could not beare the deÅ¿ire
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:151759:186"/>he hath to his abÅ¿ent friend, or his dead Å¿onne; we Å¿ay his Å¿onne or his friend will not let him reÅ¿t or be in quiet; for he is often Å¿aid to doe, that doth Å¿o worke, and moveth him either by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ell or command or impluÅ¿ion though by another. That inÅ¿tance in this caÅ¿e we may give. Zach. 11.13.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>CaÅ¿t it into the Potters field.]</hi> It is a PropheÅ¿ie of the money which <hi>Iudas</hi> Å¿hould take for the betraying of ChriÅ¿t, and what he Å¿hould do with it: And when he was to do it &amp; did caÅ¿t it into the Temple. Math. 27.5. It is Å¿poken here as if ChriÅ¿t did it, or Å¿hould doe it; not that he perÅ¿onally did it, but becauÅ¿e he moved <hi>Iudas,</hi> and after a Å¿ort compelled him to doe it.</p>
                        <p>Now the greatneÅ¿Å¿e of theÅ¿e womens Å¿orrowes are increaÅ¿ed or amplified, that they were Å¿o affected that teares came from them; and if it be thought that it is eaÅ¿ie for that Å¿ex to Å¿hed teares yet this comes not from the compoÅ¿ition, but the extreame griefe they Å¿uÅ¿tained, when they came to Å¿o many, as it were cover the Altar of God, even that Altar where they Å¿ought for eaÅ¿e and comfort. And further to amplifie it, it is Å¿aid with weeping and mourning; that is, their teares were joyned with Å¿obs and Å¿ighes, and outcryes, by which the Å¿orrow and anguiÅ¿h of their minde was increaÅ¿ed, when as God would have his Altar without all Å¿pot or injury moÅ¿t pure, Å¿acred and conÅ¿ecrated to him, inÅ¿omuch as he forbad the Å¿tones of it to be wrought or cut with any inÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of iron; it muÅ¿t needs be ungratefull and unacceptable to him when it was covered and compaÅ¿Å¿ed with teares, Å¿ighes, and lamentations of thoÅ¿e who were in miÅ¿ery, vexed by their huÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and their concubines.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Altar of the Lord]</hi> This amplifies further their Å¿orrow, that they came to the Altar of the Lord to complaine, as being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all hope of helpe from man, and all meanes, and had onely God to flye to and his helpe; for it is a figne of great oppreÅ¿Å¿ion when as men miÅ¿erable and affected with injury, come mourning and lamenting to Gods Altar to complaine to him, as thoÅ¿e who have no helpe, no defence in the counÅ¿ells or helpe of men, none in the Judges and MagiÅ¿trates of the time, againÅ¿t Å¿uch injuries.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>BecauÅ¿e the offering is no more regarded.]</hi> Or <hi>Å¿o that your offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.]</hi> It is that which containeth the injury to themÅ¿elves, for by theÅ¿e tears &amp; lamentations of the wives, the anger of the Lord was Å¿o Å¿tirred up againÅ¿t them that he Å¿aith all their Å¿acrifice &amp; offerings were not accepted or regarded of him. <hi>i.</hi> The tears of your oppreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed wives are as a vaile upon my Altar, and do all Å¿o cover it, that your Å¿acrifices, and oblations cannot be Å¿eene, or make me not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them when their cryes and their prayers come both before me, they doe Å¿o trouble and corrupt your prayers and Å¿o hinder, that they are not heard of me at all.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Ye have done againe.]</hi> In the Å¿econd place adding this Å¿inne to the former, a greater to the leÅ¿Å¿e. Some who were Å¿ingle tooke Å¿trange wives, and when others Å¿aw that was borne withall, and the magiÅ¿trates did not controule and puniÅ¿h it, they proceed to this, that having wives of the daughters of God, they tooke to them the daughters of a Å¿trange God.</p>

                           <hi>And covered the Altar of the Lord with teares.]</hi> The firÅ¿t reaÅ¿on condemning this poligamy is drawne from the grief of the wives, and it Å¿tands thus: That which is a griefe to the wife, and fills her heart with forrow and anguiÅ¿h, even then when Å¿hee comes to Gods Altar, Gods Å¿ervice ought not to be done by the husband, but Å¿uch is this.</p>
                        <p>The husband ought not to doe that which will grieve and vex his wife, and make her unfit for duties to himÅ¿elfe, <label type="milestone">

When he is preÅ¿ent, he muÅ¿t live lovingly and amiably with her, abÅ¿taining from all things that may grieve her: Å¿o Å¿hall he give her an example to do Å¿o to him. For they ought not to pleaÅ¿e themÅ¿elves, but one another. The good things that are in her, he muÅ¿t cheriÅ¿h: for as in children or Å¿ervants, Å¿o in the wife: nothing incourageth her more in any good thing, then that her husband obÅ¿erveth and approveth thoÅ¿e good things are in her. The evill things, ordinary infirmities, he muÅ¿t rather intreat God for them, then reprove her; but if either, he muÅ¿t take his fitteÅ¿t time for it: as with PhyÅ¿itians, obÅ¿erve her nature, as they their patients, and do it in love, not paÅ¿Å¿ion, with a grave, yet cheerfull countenance, letting her Å¿ee her fault out of the Word, rather then from his will and diÅ¿like. And though he be maÅ¿ter Bee, and have a Å¿ting, yet muÅ¿t he Å¿eldome or never uÅ¿e it, unleÅ¿Å¿e ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity drive him, and that by her peeviÅ¿hneÅ¿Å¿e rather then his paÅ¿Å¿ion or folly in handling of the matter. And Å¿o may he have comfort by her, and fruit of her: for Å¿hee is therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a vine, which by the care and diligence of the Gardiner in carefull pruning and underpropping it, and dreÅ¿Å¿ing of it, brings forth fruit, even grapes, whence comes wine, which rejoyceth the heart: otherwiÅ¿e it will but wallow on the ground, and remaine fruitleÅ¿Å¿e. But to conclude, provided alwayes that Å¿he be dutifull and kinde, loving and obedient unto him; or elÅ¿e Å¿he forfeits her right: and then if he be bitter and unkinde to her, I do not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant him, but I leÅ¿Å¿e blame him. If Å¿he be to him not a turtle Dove, but a chattering Pye, full of brawlings and contentions, becauÅ¿e every thing muÅ¿t not be as Å¿he would have it; I leÅ¿Å¿e blame him if he delight abroad, Å¿eeing <hi>Salomon</hi> hath Å¿aid, Prov. 21.9. <hi>It is better to dwell in a corner of the houÅ¿e top, then with a contentious wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in a wide houÅ¿e.</hi> Prov. 19.13. <hi>The contentions of a wife are as a continuall dropping.</hi> If Å¿he be, as one Å¿aith, like a vine that were planted in the flowing Å¿ea, which proÅ¿pereth leaÅ¿t when the water is loweÅ¿t: Å¿o his fellowÅ¿hip Å¿weeteÅ¿t when he is furtheÅ¿t off.

The Å¿inne is that which is againÅ¿t the ordinance and inÅ¿titution of God, that ought not to be done; Å¿uch is this. Now it is againÅ¿t his inÅ¿titution, becauÅ¿e it is againÅ¿t that covenant, whereof hee is both Author and witneÅ¿Å¿e. The way of Å¿etting down this is, by way of queÅ¿tion and anÅ¿wer, from the people, &amp; to them from God, depending upon the former. The Lord had told them it made their prayers to be rejected. They aske why it Å¿hould be Å¿o? yet ye Å¿ay wherin, or wherfore, for what cauÅ¿e, or what reaÅ¿on there was why their offerings Å¿hould be rejected, and why he would not receive their prayers?

And Å¿o it is no new rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, nor yet any Å¿trange and obÅ¿cure name of your duty mutually to be performed, that it may be accounted either a Å¿mall thing, or is to be denyed and lightly regarded, but it is moÅ¿t ancient and of long continuance, even from your youth; neither is there any thing committed by her why thou Å¿houldeÅ¿t violate thy faith and breake thy covenant with her, for Å¿o that, <hi>againÅ¿t whom thou haÅ¿t tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ed.]</hi> Is to be read, with whom thou haÅ¿t dealt unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, breaking thy covenant.</p>
                        <p>ThoÅ¿e words, <hi>hath beene witneÅ¿Å¿e.]</hi> Some underÅ¿tand as if it were meant, that he were witneÅ¿Å¿e of the injuries and indignities done againÅ¿t them. And that howÅ¿oever Å¿ome would leÅ¿Å¿en things, yet the Lord tooke notice of them, as great injuries: yet this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the very tenor of the words will not carry it, for it is not he is witneÅ¿Å¿e of, you have been unfaithfull to them, but between thee &amp; her; with whom thou haÅ¿t dealt unfaithfully. Others would have it; <hi>he is witneÅ¿Å¿e:</hi> That is, he hath conteÅ¿ted betwixt thee and her; that is, hath commanded how thou Å¿houldÅ¿t carry thy Å¿elfe towards thy wife, when he Å¿aid, Gen. 2.24.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:151759:190"/>which is of the husband to her, muÅ¿t be underÅ¿tood of the wives to him. So the Prophet here condemnes the mans perfidiouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e as a Å¿in to God. And as much <hi>Solomon</hi> inÅ¿inuates for the woman, Prov. 2.17. <hi>Which forÅ¿aketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the Covenant of her God</hi> That a leud woman dealing unfaithfully with her husband, Å¿inned againÅ¿t God, in breaking the Covenant whereof he was Authour.

A thing either unknown or neglected of moÅ¿t, as if there were no Å¿inne in it, or but onely offence againÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, as if God never regarded what they did, or as if never their faithfull carriage one to another pleaÅ¿ed him, nor tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ing diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed him. Hence it is uÅ¿uall, that when the wife hath been diÅ¿obedient to her husband, diÅ¿dainfull and deÅ¿piÅ¿ing them, becauÅ¿e they happily have more knowledge or graces then they, which Å¿ometimes falls out, though unfitly; and the huÅ¿band bitter and rough, and unkinde to her, if they drinke one to another, or uÅ¿e Å¿ome other ceremony to make reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God is never thought of, as if he were not offended, and that they ought not to humble themÅ¿elves to him. And hence it is, that this dayes falling out, or injuring, is puniÅ¿hed with the next; God puniÅ¿hing one Å¿inne with another. And whereas the man tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ed againÅ¿t her to day, Å¿he tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ed againÅ¿t him to morrow; and Å¿o they live Å¿till in Å¿inne and offences, whereas if they had truly humbled themÅ¿elves to God, they might both have the pardon of that, and obtaine the powring out of graces upon them, by which they might not afterwards tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿e one againÅ¿t another: But for want of this, comes the mutuall and daily offences betwixt them, and oftentimes Gods hand purÅ¿ues the Å¿urviver: As an unkinde man hath his recompence by a Å¿econd wife, which payes him home his Å¿innes againÅ¿t his former.

How then this, that is Å¿uch a prejudice to her and many others? A recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance made in the Court of Chancery cannot be releaÅ¿ed but by the conÅ¿ent of the Å¿ame Court. And when a recognizance is made to God, can man releaÅ¿e it without his conÅ¿ent?</p>

Can man and wife be adulterers? I would thinke not by the meere act of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another; nay Å¿ure, not now the Prophet faith they are man and wife Å¿till. Neither is there any place in the Scripture that bindeth theinnocent party to put away the nocent, but gives him liberty if he will; and if he be not bound to it, it is no adultery if he doe it not, but live Å¿till with her. But adultery hath broken the bond of marriage? I know it well, yet not Å¿o but the innocent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may if he will repaire it and knit it againe; Å¿pecially if Å¿he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, both charity and piety requires; but if not, why he may not, if he will, I know not. As in the matter of offence from a man when he repents, he is not onely bound to doe it, as Luke 17.3, 4.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:151759:194"/>but if he doe it, without repentance, in private injuries, not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to the common good, I thinke he is not reproveable. So in this. And though it were horrible for a man to beare Å¿uch an indignity from his wife, if Å¿he Å¿hall continue in it, to bring the judgement of God upon him and his houÅ¿e; yet if he paÅ¿Å¿e it over once or twice upon hope, he is not an adulterer, though he go in unto her: for they are Å¿till man and wife.</p>

It is an uÅ¿uall objection with them, that which troubled St. <hi>AuguÅ¿t. in lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Å¿up. GeneÅ¿.</hi> That is God doe now create Å¿oules, how Å¿hould that be true, that in the Å¿eventh day he reÅ¿ted from all his workes, <hi>i.</hi> the workes of creation, as it is generally taken; how then Å¿hould he create Å¿ouls? To anÅ¿wer, I demand whether that ChriÅ¿t his Å¿oule was propagated from his Mother, or created? If they Å¿ay it was propagated, they muÅ¿t needs Å¿ay it was tainted with Å¿inne originall: If they Å¿ay it was created, which the learned affirm, S. <hi>AuguÅ¿t.</hi> and others, becauÅ¿e it could not betainted with Å¿inne, then have they anÅ¿wered for us, that Å¿oules are now created. And the meaning of God ceaÅ¿ing from his worke, is that which the learned give, that after the Å¿ixt day he crated no new kinde
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:151759:196"/>of creatures or things, though he doe Å¿till make particulars of kindes.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, they Å¿ay, man begets a man, and the mother brings forth a man of body and Å¿oule like themÅ¿elves. But admit this, they beget and bring forth onely one part, and not the whole, then they beget and bring forth not like themÅ¿elves.</p>
                        <p>In anÅ¿wer, and demand, did not God make <hi>Eve</hi> of <hi>Adam?</hi> It will not be denyed; yet did he make but her body, and created her Å¿oule? And if that Å¿peech be true, why not this? though but the body onely is propagated.</p>
                        <p>Againe, I demand, brought not <hi>Mary</hi> forth our Saviour ChriÅ¿t a true and perfect man, and like her? It is granted; yet was his Å¿oule created of God, and not propagated, confeÅ¿Å¿ed of all. Then Å¿o in this. And the reaÅ¿on is given, becauÅ¿e in the body which is traduced and propagated from the parents, by vertue of the Å¿eed, there are qualities and conditions found by which it is made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a reaÅ¿onable Å¿oule, and Å¿o becauÅ¿e of that, the Å¿oule it Å¿elfe is Å¿aid to be propagated from the patents. And thus the Å¿choole probably diÅ¿puteth.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, they Å¿ay, if God create all Å¿oules, then his which is begotten by adultery, and Å¿o is the author of Å¿inne, or elÅ¿e a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worker, or a worker with the adulterers.</p>
                        <p>I anÅ¿wer firÅ¿t, a difference is to be put betwixt the action and the evill of it: God who workes in the action, is free from the evill: as in the betraying of ChriÅ¿t and murdering, all move in him and worke by him, but the evill is of themÅ¿elves.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it is anÅ¿wered by Å¿ome, that there muÅ¿t be put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, betwixt the action of an adulterer, and his will. The acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Å¿imply and of it Å¿elfe is not evill, but of things indifferent, or naturally good; the will is evill. God workes in the action, but approves not his will. S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and S. <hi>AuguÅ¿t. EpiÅ¿t.</hi> 28. <hi>ad AuguÅ¿t.</hi> Å¿et it out by this Å¿imilitude. The earth hath this goodneÅ¿Å¿e from God in it Å¿elfe, that what Å¿eede Å¿oever men caÅ¿t into it, it keepes it and nouriÅ¿heth it, and it brings forth fruit, whether the Å¿eede be lawfully taken out of a mans owne Å¿tore and garner, or it be Å¿tollen; neither for thy theft or corruption refuÅ¿eth it to take, to nouriÅ¿h, and to returne with fruit. Yet will none for this accuÅ¿e the goodneÅ¿Å¿e of the ground, nor God who hath made it fruitfull for this purpoÅ¿e: Å¿o God, who is goodneÅ¿Å¿e it Å¿elfe, if any goe in unto a woman, whether lawfully, or unlawfully, doth not ceaÅ¿e according to his decree, and firÅ¿t ordering of things, to worke with a man in framing the birth, and creating the Å¿oule, yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves he no more his adultery, then the others theft; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes and will puniÅ¿h them both. LaÅ¿tly, by this reaÅ¿on a man may deny God to have any finger in the framing of the body, as that he Å¿hould not create the Å¿oule.</p>
                        <pb n="126" facs="tcp:151759:197"/>
                        <p>Fourthly, they Å¿ay if Å¿oules be thus created, then how Å¿hould they be infected with originall Å¿inne? Is it becauÅ¿e it is joyned with the body? but how Å¿hould that be when as a corporall Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance can have no power over a Å¿pirituall? and how Å¿hould God be free from Å¿inne, but be Author of it, when he joyneth a pure Å¿oule with a Å¿innefull and corrupt body? To this I anÅ¿wer, firÅ¿t, for the firÅ¿t part. That in originall Å¿inne, two things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idered. FirÅ¿t, <hi>Adams</hi> diÅ¿obedience, as the head and roote of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, imputed moÅ¿t juÅ¿tly to them, as to his members. The reaÅ¿on is, becauÅ¿e as <hi>Adam</hi> received his juÅ¿tice for them all, Å¿o did he his injuÅ¿tice and Å¿inne, being not a private man, but the head and fountaine of all mankind, in reÅ¿pect of both, where they are called not perÅ¿onall juÅ¿tice or injuÅ¿tice, but originall. The Å¿econd is the corruption of the whole nature and the propenÅ¿ion and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of it to evill, which is the puniÅ¿hment of that diÅ¿obedience which from him to his whole poÅ¿terity, is by the juÅ¿t judgement of God derived and propagated. Now when we Å¿ay that from the conjunction of Å¿oule and body, it is defiled and infected with both theÅ¿e, we meane not as when a piece of gold falls into the dirt or mire, or as wine that is put into a muÅ¿ty caske is corrupted by them: But becauÅ¿e the firÅ¿t is imputed to the whole man this diÅ¿obedience oif <hi>Adam,</hi> as if it were his owne; for as when he is made a member of ChriÅ¿t by the holy GhoÅ¿t, the righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e of ChriÅ¿t is imputed to him, and he is truely called a juÅ¿t man. So, Å¿o Å¿oone as he is made a man and the member of <hi>Adam,</hi> this is. And Å¿econdly, becauÅ¿e of the guilt of that diÅ¿obedience, the corruption of nature and the propenÅ¿ion and inclination to evill which they uÅ¿ually have called contagion, is by the juÅ¿t decree &amp; ordination of God derived into the Å¿oule, he having Å¿o decreed from the beginning, that if <hi>Adam</hi> had Å¿tood &amp; not Å¿inned, his whol juÅ¿tice Å¿hould have beene propagated to his poÅ¿terity, whence it is called originall juÅ¿tice. So he falling and all his poÅ¿terity Å¿inning in his loyns, the whole corruption of the nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> which followed that diÅ¿obedience, Å¿hould flowfrom him as from a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine into all men, that is, both into the body and Å¿oule. Whence it is called naturall corruption, and originall Å¿inne. Thus then is the Å¿oule infected, as the body, but yet not from the body by any phyÅ¿icall contraction or contagion, but by this courÅ¿e, and hath no need to be propagated, or elÅ¿e it cannot be infected by originall Å¿inne.</p>
                        <p>Now that God by this meanes is not the Author of Å¿inne, or the pollution of the Å¿oule, becauÅ¿e he hath joyned it to the body, is manifeÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e he never infuÅ¿ed any evill either into the body or Å¿oule, for he tempts no man, James 1. Againe, God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed before all times and Å¿o would performe, to joyne the Å¿oule and body together, as well if <hi>Adam</hi> Å¿tood, as if he fell. Now what
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:151759:197"/>reaÅ¿on was there that Å¿inne comming betweene, or God foreÅ¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, Å¿hould hinder his decree, becauÅ¿e of it. This decree being moÅ¿t holy and juÅ¿t, he therefore in joyning theÅ¿e together, hath done that which he moÅ¿t holily, juÅ¿tly, and wiÅ¿ely decreed. And that corruption followed upon this, is not from the conjunction, for then it would have beene, though <hi>Adam</hi> had not fallen, but by the default of man, who is in this thing to be blamed not God: And Å¿o neither the propagation of originall Å¿inne, neither any juÅ¿t imputation that can be laid upon God, can overthrow the creation of the Å¿oules, or eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h the propagation of them.</p>
                        <p>This may teach us the excellency of the Å¿oule above the body, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">VÅ¿e </seg>2</label> the matter and the maker oftentimes commends a thing and makes it more excellent. So of theÅ¿e. The body is made but of the Å¿lime of the earth, or the Å¿lime of man, and that by the inÅ¿trument of man, and is but Å¿till duÅ¿t and aÅ¿hes, the Å¿oule is made immediately of God, and though of nothing, yet is made a matter more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then the matter of the heavens,<note place="margin">AmbroÅ¿e.</note> in nature not inferiour to the Angels. And this ought to Å¿tir up in every man a more Å¿pecial care for the Å¿oule, then the body; for the health, happineÅ¿Å¿e, and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the one, more then of the other. Not as many who beÅ¿tow more case upon their dogges and horÅ¿es and other beaÅ¿ts, then upon their Å¿oules, and yet they would not be accounted dogges and beaÅ¿ts: But their bodyes they onely Å¿eeke to pamper, and Å¿tarve their Å¿oules, and Å¿uffer them to periÅ¿h: for that they care, and this they neglect: they are like unto thoÅ¿e who having a rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous houÅ¿e, regard it not, and onely Å¿eeke to themÅ¿elves goodly orchards: or thoÅ¿e who are conÅ¿umed by a diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, neglect the care of their health, and make them apparell of cloth of gold and Å¿ilver, and Å¿uch like. Or like a Å¿ick woman who neglects the means of her recovery, and onely labours and endeavours to have wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting maides, Jewels and other ornaments. How fooliÅ¿h are all and every one of theÅ¿e, in every Å¿ober mans judgement? Then what wiÅ¿edome is it for men not to regard the Å¿oule, labouring with Å¿inne, and to prepare themÅ¿elves with all endeavour Å¿tarely houÅ¿es, great LordÅ¿hips, many troopes of Å¿ervants, dainty fare, and fine apparell for the backe and belly. As if this, not that, were more excellent; as if the body, not the Å¿oule were of Å¿o excellent a nature, as if man had begotten that, not this. But Å¿eeing it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, our care Å¿hould be contrary, as <hi>Iaakob</hi> laid his right hand upon the younger, but his left upon the elder, Å¿o our beÅ¿t care and the Å¿trength of our thoughts Å¿hould be for the Å¿oule, younger as much as it is, then the body; they Å¿hould but be left hand thoughts for the body, <hi>vide Bern Å¿erm.</hi> 6. <hi>de advem. dom. s. d. e.</hi>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:151759:198"/>Å¿o in a more Å¿peciall manner Gods. The little care they take for it, and the great care for the body, tells us, that they believe this is theirs, and not that. And as men care more for their owne then for other mens, and many a man beÅ¿towes more coÅ¿t and care upon a houÅ¿e of his owne erecting, then of one of his fathers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding: Å¿o in this. But the contrary Å¿hould be, that they Å¿hould principally care for this, and for that, but in reÅ¿pect of this. God having to duÅ¿t and aÅ¿hes joyned Å¿o excellent and immortal a Å¿oule, put in Å¿uch an earthly tabernacle Å¿o excellent a Prince. Though they ought to have care to keep that in reparation and tenantable, yet their Å¿peciall care Å¿hould be for this; for the diet, the cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the admorning and the beautifying of it, with good graces and vertues; whereas contrary the care of parents now is, onely for the bodies of theirs, how they may cloath them with Å¿carlet, with pleaÅ¿ures, and hang them with rich ornaments oif gold upon their apparell, 2 Sam. 1.24. to Å¿et them out with Lawnes and Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brickes, and deck them with all the vanities Å¿poken of, IÅ¿aiah 3. as if they would provoke God to plague both body and Å¿oule. But is it any marvell, when moÅ¿t parents care onely for their owne bodies, and not for their Å¿oules? How Å¿hould they care for the Å¿oules of their children, Å¿eeing charity ever begins at home? To them the Prophet Å¿peaketh, at leaÅ¿t by way of alluÅ¿ion, as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by Å¿ome of the learned, Haggai 1.2.4. <hi>They Å¿ay it is not yet time to looke to Gods houÅ¿e and his worke:</hi> that when they are old, they are afraid to be young Saints, they or theirs, they let Gods houÅ¿e lye waÅ¿te, and his field grow over with weeds, the Å¿oules of themÅ¿elves and their children. If they would conÅ¿ider their wayes in their hearts, they Å¿hould finde God plagues us for this Å¿inne, as for others, verÅ¿e 6.7. If any man Å¿hould hang thy houÅ¿e, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne it with cloath of gold, and hanging of Arras, and Å¿hould compell thee to Å¿it naked in aÅ¿hes, wouldÅ¿t thou take it well? thou wouldÅ¿t not. Now not another, but thou thy Å¿elfe adorneÅ¿t the houÅ¿e of thy Å¿oule with gold and pearles, and Å¿uffers thy Å¿oule to Å¿it in filthineÅ¿Å¿e and corruption: Å¿o of thy children.

Infinite it were to trouble you with all, yet Å¿ome: The greateÅ¿t is the examples of many of the holy Fathers, as recorded in the Scripture, who had many wives, and are no where repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. I anÅ¿wer; FirÅ¿t, it followes not, Their reproofe is not Å¿et downe, therefore it was not: for Å¿eeing the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves it, why may it not be Å¿uppoÅ¿ed others did Å¿o? BeÅ¿ides, many things were done, that we never finde reproved, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues not the lawfulneÅ¿Å¿e of them. The inceÅ¿t of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Lot, Davids</hi> judgement againÅ¿t <hi>MephiboÅ¿heth</hi> and with <hi>Siba,</hi> and Å¿uch like. Thirdly, if it were not, yet we live by precept, not example. Fourthly, the multitude, nor the greatneÅ¿Å¿e of offenders will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuÅ¿e, neither can antiquity preÅ¿cribe againÅ¿t the word of God. But as for the Fathers, it is anÅ¿wered by the learned: FirÅ¿t, that God remitted his law to them, which appeares, Å¿ay they, becauÅ¿e he neither reproved it by his Prophets, neither did he at the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hing of the Law, expreÅ¿Å¿ely condemne it, as he did Å¿ome others, as inceÅ¿t, Levit. 19. before they thinke <hi>Iacobs</hi> marriage of two Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters was lawfull, therefore he remitted his law: yet Å¿o, as they were not without all Å¿inne in it. For Å¿inne they conÅ¿ider either as an aberration or turning aÅ¿ide form the perfect rule of God, and Å¿o they Å¿inned: or elÅ¿e that which offends God, Å¿o that it provokes him to puniÅ¿h; and in this Å¿enÅ¿e they Å¿inned not, God thus remitting the Law. Others excuÅ¿e the Fathers becauÅ¿e they did it, and God Å¿o permitted for the increaÅ¿e of the Church, and not for any filthy &amp; unclean luÅ¿t to Å¿atisfie it: which was true in Å¿ome, though it hold not in others. As <hi>Solomon</hi> and Å¿ome others who cannot be excuÅ¿ed of incontinencie. Some excuÅ¿e, from Å¿ome probable ignorance, that either they knew not the Law, or they thought not of it, and Å¿o, though not no Å¿inne, yet a leÅ¿Å¿e Å¿inne. Some, the Å¿ucceeding ages by their predeceÅ¿Å¿ors, that though their examples make not Å¿inne to be no Å¿inne, yet to be Å¿maller Å¿innes to offend by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, who were otherwiÅ¿e good and holy men, then when any
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:151759:199"/>thing is done with a wavering conÅ¿cience, and men are bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the firÅ¿t that doe it, for they are to be judged to Å¿inne by error of judgement, then perverÅ¿ity of affection. Finally, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that God did winke at that in this people and their proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitours, for thepropagation of his people, and to give paÅ¿Å¿age to the fulfilling of his promiÅ¿e of the increaÅ¿ing of them; and though God uÅ¿ed that fact of the fathers well, yet will it not follow that they Å¿inned not, when they turned aÅ¿ide from the word of God; but if they Å¿inned in it, and Å¿o perÅ¿evered, and dyed impenitent, what Å¿hall we thinke became of them? It is probable they never repented, either becauÅ¿e they thought they Å¿inned not, or elÅ¿e becauÅ¿e they well diÅ¿cerned not their Å¿inne; and yet might be pardoned it, and were. It is true, to have Gods mercy for pardon requires repentance, yet is it not neceÅ¿Å¿ary that every man Å¿hould expreÅ¿Å¿ely repent himÅ¿elfe of every particular Å¿inne. How many things are done, which are not rightly done? yet not done wickedly by us, but in a conÅ¿cience not well informed, and Å¿o knew it not to be Å¿inne? And how many which are forgotten that they were done? and yet by a mans generall humiliation for all his Å¿innes, and craving pardon of unknowne Å¿innes, PÅ¿al. 19. pardon is obtained: And thoÅ¿e fathers often in their lives confeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing themÅ¿elves miÅ¿erable Å¿inners, and humbling themÅ¿elves, no doubt that repentance, and faith in ChriÅ¿t to come, did Å¿ave them.</p>
                        <p>But 2 Sam. 12.8. <hi>David</hi> had his maÅ¿ters wives. It is anÅ¿wered by Å¿ome that he did, becauÅ¿e God remitted his law to him.

Certaine it is many of them take barrenneÅ¿Å¿e for a croÅ¿Å¿e, and a reproach unto them, but it is onely becauÅ¿e they have not little ones to Å¿olace themÅ¿elves withall, when they are young, or to leave their wealth to, when they are of yeares, but never to propagate by them the Church, and true worÅ¿hip of God. It may be in our times they leave not unto them falÅ¿e worÅ¿hip, but that is onely thankes to the Å¿tate, not them; who if the Å¿tate did Å¿o beare it, would as well leave the one as the other to them. And that I may not Å¿lander them, I prove this from their choyÅ¿e, and from their uÅ¿e of their marriage eÅ¿tate. The firÅ¿t is apparent that they chooÅ¿e onely for beauty, though they be the daughters of men; or for riches, for portion or perÅ¿on, &amp; never reÅ¿pect religion; nay if there be the other to be had, though their religion be Å¿uÅ¿pected, and it be either none or corrupted; they will not forbeare Å¿uch marriages, though they joyn themÅ¿elves to the daughters of a Å¿trange God, at the beÅ¿t but the daughters of men, never Å¿eaÅ¿oned nor yet inclinable to the truth and true worÅ¿hip. In the law he that would not marry his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaÅ¿ed brothers wife, but another, manifeÅ¿ted that he never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to raiÅ¿e up feede to his brother: So in this.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:151759:201"/>Againe, in the uÅ¿e of marriages; many men and women, though they deÅ¿ire Å¿ome children, not many; and thoÅ¿e they have, they may happily give them civill breeding and education, and bring them up in knowledge of humane things, arts and Å¿ciences, and Å¿uch like, but no inÅ¿truction of religion. That which S. <hi>AuguÅ¿t.</hi> complaines of to God as touching his father, may many juÅ¿tly complaine of their parents. <hi>Non Å¿atageret idem pater, qualis creÅ¿ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem tibi, aut quam caÅ¿tus, dummodo eÅ¿Å¿em diÅ¿ertus.</hi> So they have little care for piety and religion, to informe them and inÅ¿truct them that way, but that they might as he Å¿aith, <hi>ut diÅ¿cerem Å¿ermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem facere, quam optimum &amp; perÅ¿uadere dictione.</hi>

                        <p>That Å¿eeing there are three Å¿peciall ends of marriage; <label type="milestone">

Thirdly, a remedy againÅ¿t incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, though all muÅ¿t be aimed at, yet principally this. The other a man may well have, and have a lawfull marriage, but without this it can be nothing Å¿o holy a marriage, Å¿eeing it wanteth the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall and the moÅ¿t holieÅ¿t end, which was the end of it even in mans innocency, when he was without Å¿inne. Therefore ought every one principally to aime at this, and indeed to have it; and therefore ought they to chuÅ¿e Å¿o, or give conÅ¿ent that this may follow; not with thoÅ¿e who have a falÅ¿e religion, or no religon, becauÅ¿e it hardly will be that the Church Å¿hould be increaÅ¿ed by them; for children will ever follow the worÅ¿e part, though it be the weaker: for a little Å¿trength drawes downward, it muÅ¿t be a great Å¿trength that muÅ¿t pull upward. Corruption is downeward and with the tyde: Religion is upward and againÅ¿t it. And having a fit match, children ought to be deÅ¿ired of them, and to account it their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. PÅ¿al. 128.3. Not for coÅ¿t or paines avoid it, or feare it; and having them to give all care and diligence for their education, to bring them up in the feare and inÅ¿truction of the Lord, to inÅ¿truct them in knowledge of God and his true worÅ¿hip, and to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them by example.

Their care was more to bring them up religiouÅ¿ly, then their paines was to bring them into the world: they loved their Å¿oules better then their bodies; and they deÅ¿ired more that they might be Gods Å¿ons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, then theirs: by which they Å¿hall increaÅ¿e their glory, for they who beget many to righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, Å¿hall Å¿hine as the Å¿tarres for ever.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:151759:202"/>to marry, for though marriage be a remedy, yet is it not onely, nor principally, for both this is an end and more principall. They who can preÅ¿erve their chaÅ¿tity in virginity, may deÅ¿ire it, but not abÅ¿olutely, but in reÅ¿pect of Å¿ome troubles, and incumbrances, which for the moÅ¿t part accompany marriage, yet they may mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for this end, which is the more excellent: I doe not Å¿ay they are bound to marry for this end, becauÅ¿e marriage is of thoÅ¿e things which are indifferent, as <hi>Bernard</hi> Å¿peakes of virginity; It is not commanded, but adviÅ¿ed, and onely they who cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, are commanded to marry; yet as there is more neceÅ¿Å¿ity in marrying for that end, Å¿o there is more religion in this end. In that a man principally reÅ¿pects himÅ¿elfe; in this God, the increaÅ¿e of the Church, and the inlarging of the kingdome of ChriÅ¿t, that which Saint <hi>AuguÅ¿tine</hi> Å¿peaketh <hi>de bono conjugali Cap.</hi> 15. may be applyed here, <hi>IuÅ¿tus qu indÃ² cupit diÅ¿Å¿olvi &amp; eÅ¿Å¿e cum ChriÅ¿to, tamen Å¿umit alimentum non cupiditate vivendi, Å¿ed officio conÅ¿ulendi, ut maneat, quod neceÅ¿Å¿arium eÅ¿t propter alios.

Quid enim Å¿it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ad Å¿alutem hominis, hoc eÅ¿t concubitus ad Å¿alutem humani generis.</hi> And Å¿o Å¿pecially for the Church and increaÅ¿e of Gods Kingdome: for though he can make children of Å¿tones, yet hath he ordained this meanes: Therefore little reaÅ¿on and leÅ¿Å¿e religion hath the Church of Rome to preferre virginity before holy marriage; for beÅ¿ides that may be Å¿aid to them, it were better they would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove virginity by their deeds, then praiÅ¿e it by their words. And as <hi>Hierom adfuriam;</hi> why doth the tongue Å¿ound out chaÅ¿tity, and the whole body Å¿hew forth uncleanneÅ¿Å¿e? Or as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> of the <hi>OrigeniÅ¿ts:</hi> You refuÅ¿e marriage, but not luÅ¿t. It is not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineÅ¿Å¿e but hypocriÅ¿ie that is in honour amongÅ¿t you. BeÅ¿ides this, virginity is never Å¿ave onely in Å¿ome reÅ¿pect better then mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, but marriage is oftentimes abÅ¿olutely better then virginity, and by no reaÅ¿on more then this; becauÅ¿e this may increaÅ¿e the Church, and bring forth Å¿onnes and daughters to God, not that. Neither is it againÅ¿t this, that Å¿ome object, that ChriÅ¿t Å¿aith, That after this life there is no marrying at all, and that, 1 Cor. 7.38. <hi>He that giveth her to marriage doth well, but he that giveth her not to marriage, doth better.</hi> For the firÅ¿t, it is not againÅ¿t us, Å¿eeing we Å¿peake of the Å¿tate of this life onely; after which, as there Å¿hall be no marriages, Å¿o no vowes of virginity. And as for S. <hi>Paul, Better</hi> with him, is as much, as fit, or more commodious. For if it were Å¿imply better, it were never lawfull to do otherwiÅ¿e, which he alloweth. Therefore he thus Å¿pake, not for the nature of the thing, but in reÅ¿pect of circumÅ¿tances, as you may Å¿ee, verÅ¿e 26.28.32.35. Finally, if virginity be the more holy, why have they made marriage a Å¿acrament rather then it? Sure, if it were more holy, it Å¿hould rather be a Å¿acrament, then marriage.</p>

                        <p>I <hi>Hate putting away, Å¿aith the Lord God of IÅ¿rael.</hi>] In this verÅ¿e the Prophet proceeded to the third maine Å¿inne here reproved in this people, Divorces; not Å¿imply condemning divorce, as if in no caÅ¿e it were lawfull, but for every vaine cauÅ¿e, and light diÅ¿like, when they hated or diÅ¿liked them, for that to put them away, is that he reproves. In the verÅ¿e we obÅ¿erve two things: FirÅ¿t, the reproofe of this Å¿inne: Å¿econdly, an admonition generall, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the particular. In the firÅ¿t, which is the Å¿inne, we obÅ¿erve the amplifications of it, which is firÅ¿t from Gods hatred: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, from an effect of thoÅ¿e husbands, who uÅ¿ed and practiÅ¿ed divorces, that they made the law of God a covert, to cover with it that violent injury and indignity they did to their wives, as men cover the body, and defaults of it with their garment.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>If thou hateÅ¿t her, put her away.</hi>] Some thinke this dependeth upon the former, as an objection made by this people in their own
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:151759:204"/>defence, againÅ¿t the former accuÅ¿ation, as unjuÅ¿tly caÅ¿t upon them, becauÅ¿e they had not committed Polygamy, Å¿eeing they had put away their firÅ¿t wives, and that according to the Law, Deut. 24. The Prophet anÅ¿weres, the Lord hates putting away, and will not indure that they Å¿hould make his Law a cover for their iniquity. Some, as S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> underÅ¿tand them as words of the PrieÅ¿t and people in their owne defence, pretending the law of God for that they did; but moÅ¿t take them as Gods words, Å¿hewing his diÅ¿like of their dealing. And if the words be read thus, as our vulgar tranÅ¿lation hath them: then they think them Å¿poken by an Irony, which they manifeÅ¿t, as they Å¿uppoÅ¿e by the words following, by which they take a judgement to be threatned. And they thinke it is manifeÅ¿t by the like, EccleÅ¿. 11.9. but Å¿eeing the words in the originall will not beare the reading, neither the Å¿econd Å¿entence will carry the Å¿enÅ¿e they would have of them; They muÅ¿t be thus read: <hi>For I hate putting away;</hi> or, <hi>putting away is an hatred unto me.</hi>] It is a thing that I am Å¿o far from approving and liking, that I utterly hate and abhor, whatÅ¿oever <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> for the hardneÅ¿Å¿e of your hearts did grant unto you, and Å¿o remitted the judiciall law, that it proceeded not againÅ¿t you to death, as adulterers, when you had put them away for Å¿light cauÅ¿es, and married others; yet that hath not excuÅ¿ed it before me, but that it is Å¿till a Å¿in, and odious unto me.

                           <hi>Saith the Lord God of IÅ¿rael.</hi>] This he addeth for confirmation of the former. That the Lord God of IÅ¿rael doth affirme and teÅ¿tifie this; who hath before profeÅ¿Å¿ed himÅ¿elfe Author of the conjunction betwixt them, and witneÅ¿Å¿e of that covenant: And doth profeÅ¿Å¿e himÅ¿elfe protector of the whole Nation of the IÅ¿raelites; and therefore with what indignation muÅ¿t he needs behold their dealing with their wives? and how can he Å¿uffer that indignity, they are offered to be put away, and others taken in their places, Å¿pecially when they are Å¿trangers and infidells?</p>

                           </label> is utterly unlawfull and forbidden of God; a thing that doth diÅ¿like and diÅ¿pleaÅ¿e him: Å¿o the Prophet affirmeth here. This our Saviour the oracle of his father more faithfull in the houÅ¿e then <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> doth Å¿hew and teach, Mat. 5.32. Mat. 19.9. It hath his force, <hi>I Å¿ay unto you,</hi> that is, many aÅ¿Å¿igne other cauÅ¿es, but I this one, onely adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. To this we may adde that the ApoÅ¿tle allowes not a man to put away his wife for infidelity, 1 Cor. 7.12.13. onely if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell will depart and make a deÅ¿ertion, he Å¿ets then the beleever at liberty, but elÅ¿e he allowes him not to put her away.

And againe, the bond is greater, becauÅ¿e the good is more publique, for this, for the propagation of mankinde, that onely for the good of the parents. Now then if the bond be greater, and that is not to be broken for any cauÅ¿e, then not this.

When a man taketh a wife and marrieth her, if Å¿o be Å¿he finde no favour in his eyes, becauÅ¿e he hath Å¿pyed Å¿ome filthineÅ¿Å¿e in her, then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and put it in her hand, and Å¿end her out of his houÅ¿e. To which I anÅ¿wer, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e, Math. 19. Å¿o that if it were lawfull then, yet not now: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I herein make ChriÅ¿t contrary to the decrees of God by <hi>MoÅ¿es:</hi> but we muÅ¿t underÅ¿tand that that law in Deuteronomy was a civill and judiciall law: And ChriÅ¿t he meddles not with civill or judiciall courÅ¿es, but morrall things. For they who governe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:151759:205"/>common wealths, propound this end unto themÅ¿elves, that if two evills, or two inconveniences happen and meete, they admit the leÅ¿Å¿e, leÅ¿t they fall into the greater. As in Å¿ome Cities they have admitted Å¿tewes and harlots, to avoide, as they Å¿ay, greater evills, which the law of God will not Å¿uffer in his common wealth. And Å¿o to this purpoÅ¿e of marriage, when unhappy, unfit, and unequall marriages are made; the one of theÅ¿e two inconveniences Å¿eemed to be neceÅ¿Å¿arily; that they who hated their wives, would either perpetually afflict and vex them, and at length kill them, or they muÅ¿t have liberty to put them away.<note place="margin">The permiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion argues no Å¿imple lawfulneÅ¿Å¿e.</note> This latter was thought more tolerable, therefore it was allowed in that common wealth; but Å¿o allowed as if God by it would make them keepe their wives, and uÅ¿e them better. For firÅ¿t, God would have him make a bill of divorce, by that to affect Å¿o hard &amp; cruell a husband, &amp; to drive him to conÅ¿ider what an unfit &amp; unworthy a thing it was for him to put away one he had enjoyed Å¿o long; for we uÅ¿e to weigh more thoÅ¿e things we write, then thoÅ¿e we Å¿peake. Secondly, that if he put her away, he was not allowed atall to take her againe, and therefore to make him not to doe it, but adviÅ¿edly, when happily upon Å¿econd thoughts he would not doe it. Thirdly, if he gave her a bill of divorce, it muÅ¿t expreÅ¿Å¿e the cauÅ¿e why he did it, clearing her that it was not for adultery, and accuÅ¿ing himÅ¿elfe that it was for Å¿ome other Å¿light cauÅ¿e, which he ought and would, if there had been any love in him at all, have covered. All which Å¿heweth, that God did it for their infirmities, and would have reÅ¿trained them from it by this meanes; and that he granted unto them was onely judiciall, that is Å¿o much as might free them from the hand of the MagiÅ¿trate, that they were not puniÅ¿hable by him, but not that which made it no Å¿inne againÅ¿t the law morrall; and before him, they were onely freed in <hi>fore civili, non conÅ¿cientiae.</hi> It is like to our law of uÅ¿ury which frees men from puniÅ¿hment of the law if they take not above Å¿uch a Å¿umme, but frees them not from Å¿in before God, providing for the good of the borrower, both that they might borrow, and when they did, not be too much oppreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed; but Å¿o, he that lends is an uÅ¿urer, and Å¿o a thiefe before God: So in this. For the Lord as a wiÅ¿e law-giver, in his judiciall lawes, permitted in a civill reÅ¿pect Å¿ome things evill in themÅ¿elves, for the avoiding of a greater miÅ¿chiefe; not to allow or juÅ¿tifie the Å¿ame from the guilt of Å¿inne, as before him in the court of conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but to exempt the Å¿ame from civil puniÅ¿hment in the external court before the MagiÅ¿trate: Å¿uch is this we Å¿peake of. Hence it is that we read not in the Scripture of any man of note for piety and holineÅ¿Å¿e which ever uÅ¿ed this, or ever gave any wife a bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce. For whereas <hi>Abraham</hi> put away <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>IÅ¿mael,</hi> it is not againÅ¿t this, for as he did it by the counÅ¿ell of the wife, Å¿o by the commandement of God, Gen. 21.12. And none that were godly
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:151759:205"/>uÅ¿ing, or practiÅ¿ing it once, though they were Å¿ubject to the Å¿ame inconveniences that others were, and Å¿o Å¿hewes that they held it not Å¿imply, and in conÅ¿cience lawfull.</p>
                        <p>Againe, they Å¿ay that 1 Cor. 7. the ApoÅ¿tle allowes divorce for another cauÅ¿e. It is anÅ¿wered, that the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿peaketh not of a divorce, but of a diÅ¿ertion, not of putting away the wife for any fault of hers, but when Å¿he forÅ¿akes the husband, for the faith and piety that is in him, and Å¿o <hi>Ã¨ contra;</hi> for the ApoÅ¿tle onely Å¿aith, if the unbeleeving depart, let him depart. But allowes not the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever in any Å¿ort to put away the unbeleever; nay, commands him to live with her, if Å¿he will abide with him. And Å¿o onely enjoyneth him to Å¿uffer a diÅ¿ertion, not to make a divorce. And Å¿o this eÅ¿tabliÅ¿heth no other cauÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>Againe, they Å¿ay, if for adultery, then much more for crimes greater then it, and Å¿o there are more cauÅ¿es of divorce. This will be anÅ¿wered out of the former: for if the ApoÅ¿tle allow not for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity then not for greater; for that is Å¿ure farre greater; and if their reaÅ¿on were good, then would this follow: infidelity is a greater Å¿inne then adultery, therefore ought a man to be put to death for that, becauÅ¿es for this he owes to dye by Gods law. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, adultery doth not make the divorce, becauÅ¿e of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e of the Å¿in, but becauÅ¿e of the oppoÅ¿ition of it to marriage, it is far more contrary to it. The reaÅ¿on is, becauÅ¿e in marriage man and wife ought to be one fleÅ¿h. Now adultery is that which doth divide them, and make not one, but two. And Å¿o doth neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, blaÅ¿phemy, idolatry, neither any Å¿uch Å¿in. For theÅ¿e and the like Å¿ins are more repugnant to God, and Å¿eparate men from him more then adultery, but it is more oppoÅ¿ite to Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; which is manifeÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e amongÅ¿t infidells, idolaters and blaÅ¿phemers, marriage is good and lawfull, though not holy.</p>
                        <p>Other things they object, as coldneÅ¿Å¿e and inability of Å¿ome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, if the one goe about to kill or poyÅ¿on the other, if the civill lawes allow it. But they are anÅ¿wered, that Å¿ome of theÅ¿e may hinder a marriage it be not, not breake it when it is. In others the MagiÅ¿trate is to be looked to for helpe. The lawes of MagiÅ¿trates cauÅ¿ing divorce for other things, if they be capitall they ought put them to death, and Å¿o end the controverÅ¿ie. If cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall, of leÅ¿Å¿e force, their law is againÅ¿t the law of God, and not tolerable.</p>

The other, an expoÅ¿tulation or conteÅ¿tation with them, of their propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, obÅ¿tinacy and other impiety, <hi>ad finem.</hi> For the firÅ¿t. The Å¿um of it is thus. Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hath God Å¿o Å¿hewed himÅ¿elfe a moÅ¿t equall and upright Judge, that yet before he manifeÅ¿ted himÅ¿elfe a moÅ¿t mercifull father, and never yet condemned and puniÅ¿hed any people, or any Nation with deÅ¿truction, baniÅ¿hment, or other puniÅ¿hment, but he firÅ¿t by his Prophets or by other means, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to draw them to repentance and their duty, from their madneÅ¿Å¿e and corruptions. And Å¿o it comes to paÅ¿Å¿e, that either truly repenting and deÅ¿iring the mercy of God, they obtaine par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or remaining obÅ¿tinate and impenient, they are moÅ¿t juÅ¿tly puniÅ¿hed. Now this ancient manner of Å¿hewing his judgements, either privately or publiquely, God commands here to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: for he Å¿aith he is about amoÅ¿t excellent worke, whereby he will make manifeÅ¿t to godly and Å¿ound hearted men, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e of his mercy, and will give proofe of the Å¿everity of his judgements to the wicked, and thoÅ¿e who are obÅ¿tinate in their Å¿in. The manner how this is expreÅ¿Å¿ed unto us, is, by a PropheÅ¿ic of two perÅ¿ons to come; the one of <hi>Iohn BaptiÅ¿t,</hi> the forerunner, calling men to repentance, and Å¿hewing Gods purpoÅ¿e both touching the godly and the reprobate: The other of the Ruler and Saviour of the world, the Judge of quicke and dead, whoÅ¿e ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable power is manifeÅ¿ted both waies, both in Å¿aving of the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:151759:216"/>good and faithfull, and in judgeing and puniÅ¿hing the wicked. The PropheÅ¿ie is then of two perÅ¿ons, and of their duties. The firÅ¿t is <hi>Iohn BaptiÅ¿t,</hi> the Å¿on of <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And Å¿peaking of this he uÅ¿eth the preÅ¿ent tenÅ¿e; he noteth the certainty of it, that is as Å¿ure as if it were already done, and as Å¿ure as if it were beheld with their eies. But there is in this thing a difference betwixt the Prophet and the EvangeliÅ¿t, one giving it to ChriÅ¿t, the other unto the Father; divers reconcile them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ly, but that which Å¿eemeth moÅ¿t plaine and true is this: That Å¿ome works are proper to the perÅ¿ons, to every one in their eÅ¿Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall proprieties; as to beget, be begotten, and proceed; and theÅ¿e are not communicable, but Å¿ome are externall and common, and Å¿ometimes are given to one perÅ¿on, Å¿ometimes to another, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeÅ¿t the unity of eÅ¿Å¿ence in the trinity of perÅ¿ons. As IÅ¿aiah 6.1. I Å¿aw the Law Å¿itting on a throne. Some thinke, St. <hi>BaÅ¿il</hi> and others, that it was the Father who appeared in that viÅ¿ion. Yet John, 12.41. It is given to the Å¿onne. And Acts, 28.25. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it unto the Å¿pirit. So that which is Å¿poken of the holy GhoÅ¿t, 2. Pet. 7.21. is affirmed of the Father. Heb. 1.1. now like to theÅ¿e is this. The Å¿ending of <hi>Iohn</hi> being common to both, is by the Prophet given to the Son, and by the EvangeliÅ¿t to God, or by ChriÅ¿t in the EvangeliÅ¿t, to Å¿hew that he was one in nature with the Father, and another in perÅ¿on.

BeÅ¿ides the end of this purging is, that they may be fit to offer up lawful Å¿acrifice to God, but in theirs the Å¿oules offer up no Å¿acrifices, Å¿ay no MaÅ¿Å¿es there. BeÅ¿ides this purgation is onely by ChriÅ¿t, through the Å¿an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the holy GhoÅ¿t, being the onely purgation that the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:151759:223"/>Å¿cripture acknowledgeth, &amp; therefore this cannot be an impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that.

We muÅ¿t from the Å¿ame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of juÅ¿tice conclude, that if there be a Purgatory, it Å¿hould be as well for the body as the Å¿oule: becauÅ¿e the body hath been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of thoÅ¿e pleaÅ¿ures and delights, for which they tell us, that the Å¿oules pay deare in Purgatory fire. But they deny any Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory for the body, therefore they cannot truly affirme there is any for the Å¿oule. For thus Å¿hall the judgements of God be juÅ¿t, (Å¿aith <hi>Epiphanius in Ancorat.</hi>) whilÅ¿t both participate, either puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Å¿in, or reward for vertue; which juÅ¿t judgement they greatly impeach, by laying upon the Å¿oule only, the puniÅ¿hment of thoÅ¿e Å¿ins which have been committed by the whole man.</p>

If <hi>Bellar. l.</hi> 1. <hi>de Å¿ancto. beatit.

The Å¿ame reaÅ¿on can e give them that for a long while after ChriÅ¿t there was none, becauÅ¿e it was doubted in the Church, whether the

Therefore muÅ¿t it follow that invocation is but an innovation. But to conclude, Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they know not our wants, nor can take notice of our prayers, &amp; heare us, neither can we have any certainety of it; if it were Å¿o, and are certaine from the word of God, that our prayers Å¿hall be heard as well as theirs; We have not need to pray to them, nor reaÅ¿on to induce us to it; we neither in this nor any other thing adore them, but as S. <hi>AuguÅ¿t. de verÃ¢ religione.</hi> 55. <hi>We honour them for imitation, but adore them not for religion.</hi>

And theÅ¿e are religious hypocrites. On the other Å¿ide, many there are who have care to deale juÅ¿tly, to performe faithfullneÅ¿Å¿e to men, are mercyfull, liberall, loving, and kinde, &amp;c.

And theÅ¿e are civill hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.

                        <p>To perÅ¿wade theÅ¿e hypocrites, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">VÅ¿e </seg>3</label> to come out of their hypocriÅ¿ie, and both them and all others to take upon them the care of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming obedience to ChriÅ¿t, in both: be carefull of religion with honeÅ¿ty, and of honeÅ¿ty with religion; this muÅ¿t be done, and the other muÅ¿t be leÅ¿t undone. HaÅ¿t thou any knowledge of God, any love of the truth, any care of the Lords day, any feare of his great name, any love to heare, or to pray? See thou be carefull of juÅ¿tice, chaÅ¿tity, Å¿obriety, obedience, fidelity, and true love to men; Or elÅ¿e for all that, when thou thinkeÅ¿t to have ChriÅ¿t, for thy Saviour, thou Å¿halt finde him but a Å¿wift witneÅ¿Å¿e, and an irefull Judge againÅ¿t thee; So on the contrary. Many will eaÅ¿ily grant me, that if a man be never Å¿o religious, Å¿o devout, and carefull of the firÅ¿t Table: yet if he be unjuÅ¿t, an extortioner, a murtherer, and Å¿uch like, As they Acts 28.5. judged of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Å¿o the Lord will not Å¿uffer him to live, but his judgements Å¿hall be upon him, and condemnation in the life to come. But if a man be juÅ¿t, chaÅ¿t, mercifull, and Å¿uch like, though he know not reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, be without the feare of God, and care of his Å¿ervice, though a Å¿wearer, &amp; blaÅ¿phemer, a prophaner of the Lords day, yet he may do well enough, and no fear of periÅ¿hing, or judgement, and Å¿o will they Å¿peake, both in life, and death; which is all one as if they Å¿hould thinke, a man which is guilty of felony, murder, and Å¿uch like, muÅ¿t needs be judged by the law of the land; but if not of theÅ¿e, though he be a traytor to the Kings perÅ¿on, yet is there no feare. But if a traytor Å¿hall die though not guilty of felony, and a felone, though not culpable of treaÅ¿on, by the juÅ¿tice of mans law; much more they who Å¿hall Å¿eparate theÅ¿e two Tables. Therefore muÅ¿t we endeavour, to be religiouÅ¿ly honeÅ¿t, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿tly religious, to avoide the tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ions of both Tables, and to do the duties of them; leÅ¿t if we Å¿eparate theÅ¿e, we lay our Å¿elves open to the judgements of God in this life, and Å¿eparate our Å¿elves from the comfortable, and happy preÅ¿ence of the Lambe, and him that Å¿itteth upon the Throne.</p>

                        <p>BecauÅ¿e that as the bleÅ¿Å¿ing of God was upon the people, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> their lands and labours, or denied to them, he alÅ¿o might be partaker of their aboundance and want; to abound with them, and to want with them; for where much, he was to receive much; and where little, the leÅ¿Å¿e, alwaies proportionable to them, Num. 18.27. that out of this fellow Å¿eeking, he might praiÅ¿e God with them, or pray more earneÅ¿tly for them.</p>

As he that goeth to warfare, may of duty and juÅ¿tice require his wages of thoÅ¿e for whom he fighteth; he that planteth a vineyard may of duty chalenge to eate thereof; or he who feedeth a flocke may of duty chalenge to eate the milke of the flocke.

Now tÅ¿eeing he hath no need of theÅ¿e things himÅ¿elfe, but hath given hem to others, his MiniÅ¿ters, by whom he will receive them, and communicate by them Å¿pirituall things alÅ¿o, not taking his own for nothing; theÅ¿e muÅ¿t know that though no law of man binde them, yet are they bound to give of their goods, and with Å¿ome proportion of the tenth, for a better rule they cannot have, to the maintenance of the MiniÅ¿tery.</p>

And hence it comes to paÅ¿Å¿e, that what the MiniÅ¿ter hath of favour, once yielded unto, and for peace, they hold him thereby bound for ever, though the tithes and price of things do never Å¿o much alter. And againe, againÅ¿t all right they binde the Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿or to the fact and fault of his predeceÅ¿Å¿or, whereby in many things it comes to paÅ¿Å¿e, that where a Å¿hilling is due, there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not a penny to the purÅ¿e of the MiniÅ¿ter: As in many places, there is leÅ¿t to the MiniÅ¿ter but two pence a Cow, by the yeare, and Å¿o much for an acre of meadow: yea in many places, nothing tith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, though men have never Å¿o great paÅ¿tures, and Å¿o many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ands of Å¿heep, becauÅ¿e Abbey land, theÅ¿e fulfilling the iniquity of thoÅ¿e Fathers who then robbed the Church, for their owne bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.

But me thinks I heare Å¿ome men an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wering, that too much is not good for a MiniÅ¿ter, and many of them grow worÅ¿e by riches, idle, and proud, and negligent. And therefore as the Emperiour <hi>Frederick</hi> Å¿aid, <hi>de papa &amp; clericis,</hi> of the Pope and his cleargy,<note place="margin">Detrahamus illis nocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes divitias, hoc enim fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere opus eÅ¿t charitatis.</note> Å¿o Å¿ay they,* <hi>Let us take from them the riches that do hurt them, for this is a worke of charity.</hi> I anÅ¿wer, I plead not for too much, but for a convenient maintenance; I commend them not, that are worÅ¿e by their abundance, yet are they men like others, and have the Å¿ame infirmities, and too many of theÅ¿e objectors, though not to all, may I Å¿ay: hypocrites, pull out the beame out of your owne eies; who more corrupt, careleÅ¿Å¿e, and proud, then they by their abundance? Yet would they think it a bad concluÅ¿ion, that they Å¿hould have their riches withheld from them. But doe they thinke the portion of tithes, and the like; too much for them? happily they are unequally divided by the law, let that be remedied, &amp; there will be found little enough. But is this to much? What think they of Gods proportion, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to his, not only tithes, but firÅ¿t fruit and offerings, which came to no Å¿mall matter? BeÅ¿ides, as much land as the greateÅ¿t City came to, if the deÅ¿cription of Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> be true, who <hi>ad Dardanum</hi> Å¿aith, that the length from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>BeerÅ¿heba</hi> was 160. miles; the breadth from <hi>Ioppa</hi> to <hi>Bethleem,</hi> 46. miles. Now the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites portion of land was 48. Cities, Num. 35.7. every City had in Suburbs, 2000. Cubites from the wall round, verÅ¿e 5. which wil afford a large portion to the Levites of this land. And is it too much now for the MiniÅ¿ters to have proportionable tenths, and a little glebe? But let theÅ¿e men take heed, leÅ¿t the love of the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:151759:247"/>world, and the deceitfulnes of riches, have not excluded the love of God our Saviour, as Joh. and the care of his worÅ¿hip and honour, and leÅ¿t the envy and diÅ¿daine, which uÅ¿ually is in the world, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the MiniÅ¿tery be in them, when they think nothing enough for themÅ¿elvs, to have and joyne houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e, and land to land, till they dwell as Princes of the earth alone; but if any portion be allotted to the Å¿ervants of God, as a reward not only of their former Å¿tudies, but alÅ¿o of their preÅ¿ent labours, it is thought too much; and of them who will give the Lawiers free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the maintenance of their titles, and often but quarrels; nd to the PhyÅ¿itian a large fee for taking care of their bodies; but the MiniÅ¿ter a Å¿mall pittance, for the Å¿aving of their Å¿oules: which of many, make men feare, they never reaped Å¿pirituall things by us, though they heare us often, becauÅ¿e they never part with any temporall things to them, or not without grudging and repining, or but in a marvelous Å¿lacke and pinching meaÅ¿ure. The man who hath received health by his PhyÅ¿itian, and right by his Lawier, will give him both his fee, and reverence; if not, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him but Å¿lenderly; So in this: And Å¿o men Å¿top their eares to this of the Prophet; yet for all this, thinke I it not tolerable, that a MiniÅ¿ter Å¿hould neglect the care of his flocke, while he hath charge of them, but Å¿trive to do it, becauÅ¿e, 1. Cor. 9.16.17. <hi>Though I preach the GoÅ¿pell, I have nothing to rejoyce of: for neceÅ¿sitie is laid upon me, and wo is unto me, if I preach not the GoÅ¿pell: for if I do it willingly, I have a reward: but if I do it againÅ¿t my will, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding the diÅ¿penÅ¿ation is committed to me.</hi> For this will not be a plea for the MiniÅ¿ter, at ChriÅ¿ts judgement Å¿eat, when he muÅ¿t give an account how he fed the flocke of ChriÅ¿t: It may be a plea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t them to condemne them, not acquit him. Therefore Å¿hould it not be Å¿o, that though they keep him poore, which is their Å¿in, he Å¿hould Å¿hut peace out of his owne heart, which would not be, if he laboured painfully, and looked to the Lord for his reward.

TheÅ¿e are all Å¿peakers againÅ¿t God, when the Word and ReaÅ¿on witneÅ¿Å¿eth of him, that his providence is over all theÅ¿e: as in generall, PÅ¿al. 113.5.6. in great things, Prov. 16.9.21.1. in particular actions, Jerem. 10.23. Acts 17.28. in Å¿maller, Job 38.3. Matth. 6.26.28. and 10.50. and many other of the like kinde, beÅ¿ide reaÅ¿on; as that the world doth Å¿o long continue, that the heavens Å¿till keep their certaine and perpetuall motion, that there are interchanging of things; and as the day Å¿ucceeding of the night, and the winter of the Å¿ummer; that the earth being founded upon the waters, &amp; compaÅ¿Å¿ed about with it, and yet it neither Å¿inketh nor is over-flowed: will not all theÅ¿e prove his providence? Å¿pecially when they are created of nothing, when many things are compounded of contraries, and by a naturall enmitie Å¿eeke the ruine, and would wrack one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For they muÅ¿t needs be preÅ¿erved of Å¿ome other; but of none but God: for who elÅ¿e is able to Å¿uÅ¿tain, to rule and govern Å¿o great a maÅ¿Å¿e, and Å¿o infinite creatures, but an infinite power? To deny them this, is to Å¿peake againÅ¿t God himÅ¿elfe; of which all theÅ¿e are guilty, either out of the dulneÅ¿Å¿e of their braines, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to comprehend greater things then are before their eyes, and which may be groped and felt; or elÅ¿e out of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneÅ¿Å¿e and corruption of their hearts, who living wickedly and filthily, leÅ¿t the continuall remembrance of this Å¿hould vex and diÅ¿quiet them, and the perpetuall feare of puniÅ¿hment torment them, they frame this comfort to themÅ¿elves.

Or as <hi>Gregory Nazi anzen:</hi> If thou heare a Harp Å¿ound of divers Å¿trings, and all keep one harmony, thou wilt conceive of one that Å¿trikes them, though thou Å¿ee him not: Å¿o in the government of the world. Yea, when they cannot Å¿ee the reaÅ¿on of things that are done, yet men ought to admire the wiÅ¿edome of God.

Finally, well and with good reaÅ¿on may they imagine, that if a Father will governe his houÅ¿e, and a King will not forÅ¿ake his kingdome, God will much more governe the world, and not forÅ¿ake it. And if a Å¿hip, though well built and Å¿trong, as <hi>Chry Å¿oÅ¿tom,</hi> cannot be preÅ¿erved in the Å¿ea without a governour; no, not a day in the middeÅ¿t of the waves, nor the body Å¿eparated from the Å¿oule, how Å¿hould this be?

MuÅ¿t we then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the Fountaine by the Chanell, or this by that? Thirdly, His third reaÅ¿on is from the laÅ¿t words of the verÅ¿e, <hi>LeÅ¿t I come, &amp;c.</hi> which are, he Å¿aith, underÅ¿tood of the Å¿econd comming of ChriÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e his firÅ¿t comming was to Å¿ave, not to judge or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿troy. I anÅ¿wer, It is not ChriÅ¿t that Å¿peakes theÅ¿e words, but the Father, who verÅ¿e three, was called <hi>The Lord of HoÅ¿ts,</hi> a title not given to <hi>ChriÅ¿t.</hi> And the words are not meant, of the deÅ¿truction of the wicked at the laÅ¿t judgement, but of Gods plaguing them in this life, for contemning of ChriÅ¿t, as their owne <hi>Montanus</hi>
                           <pb n="285" facs="tcp:151759:276"/>doth alÅ¿o interpret it: <hi>Bellarm ine</hi> alÅ¿o would prove it as <hi>Ribera</hi> doth, that the words referre to ChriÅ¿ts Å¿econd comming, becauÅ¿e that day is called <hi>Great and fearfull,</hi> whereas ChriÅ¿ts firÅ¿t com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming is acceptable, and a day of Å¿alvation. I anÅ¿wer, that ChriÅ¿ts Å¿econd comming, in reÅ¿pect of no other thing, nor to any other perÅ¿ons, is great and fearefull, then his firÅ¿t comming is, and? <hi>contra,</hi> for his Å¿econd comming, to his owne, is a day of Å¿alvation, and they are bid to lift up their heads when it approaches: but to the wicked, both the firÅ¿t and Å¿econd comming are fearfull, and full of horror. Therefore <hi>Montanus</hi> interprets it thus: the day is great in reÅ¿pect of the good, &amp; dreadfull in reÅ¿pect of the wicked; reÅ¿embling this place to that of <hi>Iohn,</hi> Matth. 3.12.</p>
                        <p>But the reaÅ¿on why the PapiÅ¿ts contend it Å¿hould be the true <hi>Eliah,</hi> is, becauÅ¿e they might prove that the Pope is not Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriÅ¿t. This is one of <hi>Sanders</hi> his great demonÅ¿trations to prove it, becauÅ¿e <hi>Eliah</hi> muÅ¿t reÅ¿iÅ¿t AntichriÅ¿t, but <hi>Eliah</hi> is not yet come to do it. <hi>ergo,</hi> But what Prophet, what ApoÅ¿tle, what Scripture, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver told them any Å¿uch thing.

Let Å¿uch as have leaÅ¿ure, and thinke it worth the time, Å¿atisfy themÅ¿elves farther; to me it is plaine by the matter that he handles, that he prophecyed after the Temple was built (for he reproves their profaning of the Altar) and a little before the comming of <hi>Ezra,</hi> for he inveighed againÅ¿t their marrying with Å¿trangers, which <hi>Ezra</hi> by his authority did remedy. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> tells us hee was borne after the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and dyed young.

They look't Å¿o ornefully on the meane building and ornaments of the Temple, for it did not anÅ¿wer the glory of the former houÅ¿e; So <hi>Tarnovius:</hi> or, 3. BecauÅ¿e the <hi>Iewes</hi> were newly returned and were yet but poore, and could not bring Å¿uch rich oblations, therefore the PrieÅ¿ts grew cold and careleÅ¿Å¿e in attending on the altar: or, 4. BecauÅ¿e they Å¿aw what was brought conÅ¿umed with fire, they thought any thing good enough for the fire, good enough to be burnt. The truth is, The low and cheape opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Gods worÅ¿hip, hath ever made a greater waÅ¿te upon religion, than an over-high; and there is leÅ¿Å¿e danger (though there be danger) in Å¿uperÅ¿tition then in profaneneÅ¿Å¿e. Hence it was that the piety of ancient ChriÅ¿tian times was Å¿o much in their reverent demeanour in Gods houÅ¿e, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e their devotion had much faeculentie and droÅ¿Å¿e admixt. Among the many <hi>Canons</hi> to this purpoÅ¿e of other Churches, and our owne, every where obvious, I cannot but here inÅ¿ert that very devout one which fell into my obÅ¿ervation at the time of the collecting of theÅ¿e notes, which Sir <hi>Hen.

For if the Lord caÅ¿t thoÅ¿e out of the Temple which bought or Å¿old Å¿uch victimes as were to be offered to himÅ¿elfe; how much more offended will he caÅ¿t out them who pollute that place Å¿et apart, for divine worÅ¿hip, with vaine leaÅ¿ings, mirthes, and Å¿uch like toyes.</hi> The place is, <hi>Inter Capitula incertae editionis, Cap,</hi> 10. <hi>In Concil.

                     <p>Upon this neceÅ¿Å¿ity of laying hold upon the altars when they addreÅ¿Å¿ed themÅ¿elves to the Deity, <hi>Robert Stephanus</hi> in his <hi>TheÅ¿aurus</hi> alleadge <hi>Varro,</hi> that the old Latine word for Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars was <hi>AnÅ¿ae</hi> (the eares or handles of a pot) and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward changed into <hi>Arae.</hi>

                        <hi>The Altar of the Lord]</hi> This is an amplifying of their grieÅ¿e. Their injury was extreame, that they are driven to the laÅ¿t refuge; men repaire unto the Altar when all helpe failes. And further, at the Altar they Å¿hould rejoyce before the Lord as the cuÅ¿tome was when they came up with their wives to the Temple, 1 <hi>Sam,</hi> 1. yet there, even there they are
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:151759:315"/>cauÅ¿ed to weepe. Tis called, the altar of the Lord, It is his Å¿tanding place, the ordinary reÅ¿idence of God where theÅ¿e diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed women were confident to finde him and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine themÅ¿elves to him: that is, more Å¿olemnly, and for a publique witneÅ¿Å¿e of their miÅ¿erie; for elÅ¿e God who is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where doth every where obÅ¿erve the teares of them that are oppreÅ¿Å¿ed.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, the Å¿econd aggravation of their Å¿inne is, that thereby they did alÅ¿o hurt themÅ¿elves in that they made their owne offerings not to bee accepted. <hi>InÅ¿omuch that here gardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth it with good will at your hand.</hi>] The teares and groanes of your wives move God more then your Å¿acrifices doe; Å¿o that he regards them not, hee will not lookeat them, or turne his face towards them.

But (which he makes the Prophets anÅ¿wer) your iniquity Å¿hall thereby Å¿o abound and Å¿well, that no garment will be able to cover it. The Law permitting it onely for the hardneÅ¿Å¿e of your hearts, but not freeing you from Å¿inne, if raÅ¿hly and without cauÅ¿e you put them away.

                     <p>Being thus rid of this interpretation, wee have another, which interprets the place of <hi>ChriÅ¿ts firÅ¿t comming;</hi> and we have S. <hi>Markes</hi> autority for it, who makes the laÅ¿t words of <hi>Malachy,</hi> to bee the firÅ¿t words of his <hi>GoÅ¿pell;</hi> and therefore leades us to underÅ¿tand by <hi>Elias</hi> in the Prophet, <hi>Iohn BaptiÅ¿t</hi> in his GoÅ¿pell.

                     <p>Let me here note by the way the conceit of <hi>Lucas OÅ¿iander,</hi> who as he yields the place to bee meant of <hi>Iohn BaptiÅ¿t,</hi> the <hi>Å¿econd Elias</hi> before <hi>ChriÅ¿ts firÅ¿t comming;</hi> Å¿o hee alÅ¿o interprets it of a <hi>third Elias</hi> before <hi>ChriÅ¿ts Å¿econd comming,</hi> and that is, <hi>Martin Luther;</hi> and accordingly interprets the following words, and exhorts to the receiving of <hi>Luthers</hi> doctrine, leÅ¿t God come and puniÅ¿h our ingratitude. <hi>Luther</hi> indeed was a man of notable zeale like <hi>Elias,</hi> fit for the buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e hee was employed in by God, and we have great reaÅ¿on to thinke ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably of him; but none to thinke that <hi>Malachy</hi> thought of him, or that the <hi>Holy GhoÅ¿t</hi> meant him here.
